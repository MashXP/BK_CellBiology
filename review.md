## 1. Cytoskeleton Components

The cytoskeleton consists of three main fiber types: microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments.

### Microtubules (Vi ống)

* **Composition**: Built from **tubulin** heterodimers (1 alpha and 1 beta subunit).
* **Activation**: Subunits must be activated by **GTP**. Beta-tubulin can hydrolyze GTP to GDP, which leads to filament shortening or "catastrophe".
* **Polarity**: They have a **plus (+)** end (fast polymerization/slow shrinkage) and a **minus (-)** end (slow polymerization/fast shrinkage).
* **Functions**: Form the **mitotic spindle** during cell division and structures like **cilia and flagella** (9+2 pair arrangement).
    *   **Types of Spindle Microtubules**: Astral, Kinetochore, and Interpolar.
* **Motor Proteins**: **Dynein** and **kinesin** move along microtubules to transport cargo.

### Microfilaments (Vi sợi)

* **Composition**: Made of **Actin** (G-actin is the globular form).
* **Activation**: Requires **ATP** for assembly.
* **Polarity**: Like microtubules, actin filaments have (+) and (-) ends and exhibit dynamic instability.

### Intermediate Filaments (Sợi trung gian)

* **Size**: Intermediate between microtubules and microfilaments.
* **Structure**: Formed by fibrous protein tetramers twisted into ropelike bundles.
* **Distribution**: Found in animal cells but **absent** in plant and fungal cells.

## 2. Metabolism: Energy Production

Cells generate energy through electron transport chains (ETC) in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

### Cellular Respiration (Mitochondrial ETC)

* **Complexes**: Four main complexes (I, II, III, IV).
* **Electron Donors**: **NADH** provides electrons to Complex I; **FADH2** provides electrons to Complex II.
* **Intermediates**: **Ubiquinone (UQ)** carries electrons between I/III, and **Cytochrome C (Cytc)** carries them between III/IV.
* **ATP Synthesis**: Proton (H+) pumping from the matrix to the intermembrane space creates a gradient that powers **ATP Synthase**.

### Photosynthesis (Chloroplast ETC)

* **Location**: Occurs on the **thylakoid membrane** during the light phase.
* **Photosystems**: PSII (absorbs light first) and PSI.
* **Electron Source**: **Water (H2O)** is split to provide electrons, releasing **O2**.
* **Types**:
    * **Non-cyclic**: Produces both **ATP and NADPH**.
    * **Cyclic**: Produces **only ATP**.

## 3. Cell Cycle and Regulation

The cell cycle is an ordered series of events for cell division.

### Phases

* **Interphase**: Includes **G1** (growth), **S** (DNA replication), and **G2** (preparation for mitosis).
* **M Phase**: Mitosis (Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase) and **Cytokinesis**.
    *   **Animal Cells**: Cytokinesis involves a **contractile ring** made of actin and myosin filaments.
    *   **Plant Cells**: Have a rigid wall and use a **phragmoplast** (microtubule-based) to guide Golgi-derived vesicles to form a new cell wall (cell plate).
* **G0 Phase**: A resting state where cells (like neurons) perform functions but do not divide.

### Checkpoints and Control

* **Checkpoint 1 (G1)**: Checks cell size, nutrients, and DNA damage.
* **Checkpoint 2 (G2)**: Checks for DNA damage and completion of replication.
* **Checkpoint 3 (M phase)**: Checks for proper chromosome attachment.
* **Cyclins & Cdks**: Progression is driven by **Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (Cdks)** which must bind to **Cyclins** to be active.

| Cyclin-Cdk Complex | Cyclin | Cdk Partner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| G1-Cdk | Cyclin D | Cdk4, Cdk6 |
| G1/S-Cdk | Cyclin E | Cdk2 |
| S-Cdk | Cyclin A | Cdk2 |
| M-Cdk | Cyclin B | Cdk1 |

### Important Regulatory Proteins

* **Rb Protein**: Inhibits transcription; mitogens trigger its phosphorylation to allow cell cycle entry.
* **p53**: Activated by DNA damage; induces **p21** (a Cdk inhibitor) to arrest the cycle for repair.
* **APC/C**: Anaphase Promoting Complex. It triggers the destruction of **Securin** (which inhibits Separase). Active **Separase** then cleaves **Cohesins** (which hold sister chromatids together) to initiate anaphase.

## 4. Cell Signaling

Cells respond to extracellular signals through various receptors and pathways.

* **Response Speed**: **Fast** responses alter existing protein function; **slow** responses involve changes in gene expression (transcription/translation).
* **Molecular Switches**:
*   **Response Speed**: **Fast** responses alter existing protein function; **slow** responses involve changes in gene expression (transcription/translation).
*   **Molecular Switches**:
    1.  **Phosphorylation**: Controlled by **kinases** (turn ON) and **phosphatases** (turn OFF).
    2.  **GTP-binding**: Controlled by **GEFs** (exchange GDP for GTP to turn ON) and **GAPs** (hydrolyze GTP to turn OFF).

*   **Receptor Classes**:
    *   **Ion-channel-coupled**: Opens/closes in response to a signal.
    *   **GPCRs**: G-protein-coupled receptors.
    *   **RTKs**: Receptor Tyrosine Kinases; they dimerize and cross-phosphorylate upon ligand binding.
*   **Signaling Example (GPCR)**:
    *   G-protein activates **Phospholipase C**.
    *   Phospholipase C cleaves inositol phospholipid into **IP3** and **Diacylglycerol (DAG)**.
    *   **IP3**: Opens Ca2+ channels in the ER, releasing Ca2+ into cytosol.
    *   **DAG**: Activates **Protein Kinase C (PKC)** (with help of Ca2+).

## 5. Genetics and Mutations

### Classical Genetics

* **Genotype vs. Phenotype**: Genotype is the set of alleles; phenotype is the visible characteristic.
* **Complementation Test**: Used to determine if two recessive mutations with the same phenotype are in the same or different genes.
* **Genetic Mapping**: The further apart two genes are on a chromosome, the higher the chance of **crossing-over**.

### Mutations and Analysis

* **Types**: Nucleotide substitution, insertion, and deletion.
* **SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms)**: Used as molecular markers to track common diseases and map mutation locations.
* **RNA Interference (RNAi)**: A method used to conduct genome-wide screens by silencing specific genes.
