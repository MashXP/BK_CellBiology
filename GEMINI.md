# User Preferences

The user has specified the following learning preferences and goals:

*   **Learning Style:** A mix of reading, videos, and hands-on practice.
*   **Background:** Intermediate computer literacy from a Bioinformatics background.
*   **Primary Goal:** To solidify their computer science foundation.
*   **Interests:**
    *   Understanding the structure and philosophy of biocomputational tools.
    *   Deeply understanding and properly utilizing AI.
*   **Project Aspiration:** To create a novel and practical project at the intersection of Computational Biology and AI.

# Session Routines

*   **Warm-up Quiz:** At the beginning of each lesson, generate a 5-10 multiple-choice quiz in a markdown file to warm up.
*   **Feynman Technique Review:** After covering new material, conduct a review session where the user explains the concepts back to me to ensure understanding.
*   **Proactive Quizzing:** I will proactively offer quizzes and feedback sessions after new material is covered, as this is the user's preferred learning style.
