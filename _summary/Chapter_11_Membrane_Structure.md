# **Summary: Chapter 11 - Membrane Structure**

## **I. The Lipid Bilayer**
*   **Fundamental Structure:** All cell membranes share a common structure: a thin film of lipid and protein molecules, held together mainly by noncovalent interactions. The core structure is the **lipid bilayer**, which forms a permeability barrier.
*   **Amphipathic Lipids:** Membrane lipids are **amphipathic**, meaning they have a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and a hydrophobic (water-fearing) tail. The most common are **phospholipids**.
*   **Spontaneous Assembly:** In an aqueous environment, the amphipathic nature of membrane lipids drives them to spontaneously form a bilayer. Hydrophilic heads face the water on both surfaces, while hydrophobic tails are shielded from water in the interior. This arrangement is self-sealing and forms closed compartments (e.g., vesicles, organelles, or whole cells).
*   **Two-Dimensional Fluid:** The lipid bilayer behaves as a two-dimensional fluid. Individual lipid molecules can move freely within the plane of their own monolayer through **lateral diffusion** and rotation. However, spontaneous movement from one monolayer to the other ("flip-flop") is very rare.
*   **Membrane Fluidity:** The fluidity of the bilayer depends on its composition:
    *   **Hydrocarbon Tails:** Shorter tails and the presence of double bonds (which create kinks and make tails **unsaturated**) increase fluidity.
    *   **Cholesterol:** In animal cells, cholesterol stiffens the membrane by fitting into the gaps between phospholipid molecules, making the bilayer less fluid and less permeable.
*   **Membrane Asymmetry:** The two monolayers of the lipid bilayer have different lipid compositions. This asymmetry is established in the Golgi apparatus by enzymes called **flippases** and is functionally important. For example, **glycolipids** are found exclusively in the noncytosolic monolayer, forming part of the cell's outer carbohydrate coat.

## **II. Membrane Proteins**
*   **Functions:** Membrane proteins carry out most of the membrane's specific functions, such as transport, anchorage, signal reception, and enzymatic activity.
*   **Association with the Bilayer:** Proteins associate with the membrane in several ways:
    *   **Transmembrane Proteins:** Extend through the bilayer, with portions exposed on both sides. They are amphipathic.
    *   **Monolayer-Associated Proteins:** Anchored to the cytosolic surface by an amphipathic α-helix.
    *   **Lipid-Linked Proteins:** Covalently attached to lipid molecules embedded in the bilayer.
    *   **Protein-Attached Proteins (Peripheral):** Bound indirectly to the membrane by interactions with other membrane proteins.
*   **Transmembrane Domains:** The polypeptide chain of a transmembrane protein crosses the lipid bilayer in specific conformations, most commonly as an **α-helix** or, less often, as a rolled-up β-sheet (**β-barrel**). In an α-helix, hydrophobic amino acid side chains contact the lipid tails, while the hydrophilic backbone atoms form hydrogen bonds with each other inside the helix. Multiple α-helices can group together to form an aqueous pore.
*   **Solubilization:** Membrane proteins can be extracted and solubilized from the bilayer using **detergents**, which are small, amphipathic molecules that disrupt hydrophobic associations.
*   **Cell Cortex and Glycocalyx:**
    *   **Cell Cortex:** The plasma membrane of animal cells is reinforced by an underlying meshwork of fibrous proteins, the cell cortex (e.g., spectrin in red blood cells), which provides mechanical strength and helps restrict protein movement.
    *   **Carbohydrate Layer (Glycocalyx):** The external surface of the plasma membrane is coated with sugars attached to proteins (glycoproteins) and lipids (glycolipids). This layer protects the cell and is involved in cell-cell recognition.
*   **Protein Mobility:** Like lipids, many membrane proteins can diffuse laterally within the bilayer. However, cells can restrict the movement of specific proteins by tethering them to the cell cortex, the extracellular matrix, or proteins on an adjacent cell, creating specialized **membrane domains**.
