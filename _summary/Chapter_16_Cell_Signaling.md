## **I. General Principles of Cell Signaling**
*   **Signal Transduction:** Cell communication involves converting signals from one form to another, a process known as signal transduction. A signaling cell produces an **extracellular signal molecule** that is detected by a **receptor** on a target cell.
*   **Forms of Signaling:**
    *   **Endocrine:** Long-range; hormones are broadcast through the bloodstream.
    *   **Paracrine:** Short-range; signals (local mediators) diffuse locally to affect nearby cells.
    *   **Neuronal:** Long-range but specific; electrical signals are converted to chemical signals (neurotransmitters) at synapses.
    *   **Contact-Dependent:** Direct physical contact between a membrane-bound signal and a receptor on an adjacent cell.
*   **Cellular Response:** A cell's response to a signal depends on its unique set of receptors and the intracellular machinery that interprets the signal. A single signal molecule can elicit different responses in different target cells.
*   **Intracellular Signaling Pathways:** A receptor relays an extracellular signal into the cell, activating a cascade of **intracellular signaling molecules**. These pathways can:
    1.  **Relay** the signal onward.
    2.  **Amplify** the signal.
    3.  **Integrate** signals from different pathways.
    4.  **Distribute** the signal to multiple effector proteins.
*   **Molecular Switches:** Many signaling proteins act as molecular switches, toggling between an active and inactive state. The two main classes are proteins activated/inactivated by **phosphorylation** (via protein kinases/phosphatases) and **GTP-binding proteins**.

## **II. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)**
*   **Structure and Activation:** GPCRs are the largest family of cell-surface receptors. They are seven-pass transmembrane proteins. Binding of an extracellular signal causes the GPCR to activate a trimeric **G protein** on the cytosolic side of the membrane.
*   **G Proteins:** Act as molecular switches. An activated GPCR induces the G protein's α subunit to release GDP and bind GTP. This activation typically causes the α subunit and the βγ complex to separate and activate their respective downstream targets. The α subunit inactivates itself by hydrolyzing its bound GTP.
*   **Downstream Targets:** Activated G proteins can directly regulate ion channels or activate membrane-bound enzymes.
*   **Second Messengers:** The two most common target enzymes for G proteins are:
    1.  **Adenylyl Cyclase:** Produces the small intracellular signaling molecule **cyclic AMP (cAMP)**.
    2.  **Phospholipase C:** Generates **inositol trisphosphate (IP₃)** and **diacylglycerol (DAG)**.
*   **cAMP Pathway:** cAMP activates **protein kinase A (PKA)**, which then phosphorylates various target proteins, leading to rapid responses (e.g., glycogen breakdown) or slow responses (changes in gene transcription).
*   **Inositol Phospholipid Pathway:** IP₃ opens Ca²⁺ channels in the ER membrane, releasing Ca²⁺ into the cytosol. The rise in cytosolic Ca²⁺, along with DAG, activates **protein kinase C (PKC)**. **Ca²⁺** itself is a ubiquitous second messenger that triggers many cellular processes by binding to Ca²⁺-responsive proteins like **calmodulin**.

## **III. Enzyme-Coupled Receptors**
*   **Structure and Activation:** Transmembrane proteins that have an enzymatic activity in their cytosolic domain or are directly associated with an enzyme. The largest class is the **Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)**.
*   **RTK Activation:** Binding of a signal molecule causes two receptor molecules to dimerize. This brings their intracellular kinase domains together, and they phosphorylate each other on specific tyrosines.
*   **Intracellular Signaling Complex:** The phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for a variety of intracellular signaling proteins, which then relay the signal onward.
*   **Ras and MAP-Kinase Pathway:** Most RTKs activate **Ras**, a monomeric GTPase. Activated Ras initiates a phosphorylation cascade known as the **MAP-kinase signaling module**, which relays the signal to the nucleus to regulate gene expression and cell proliferation. Mutations that hyperactivate Ras are common in cancer.
*   **PI 3-Kinase Pathway:** Many RTKs activate **PI 3-kinase**, which phosphorylates inositol phospholipids in the plasma membrane. These lipids become docking sites for signaling proteins, including the protein kinase **Akt**. Activated Akt promotes cell survival and growth, often by phosphorylating and inhibiting proteins that promote apoptosis (e.g., Bad).
