# **Summary: Chapter 17 - Cytoskeleton**

## **I. General Principles**
*   **The Cytoskeleton:** A dynamic and intricate network of protein filaments that extends throughout the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. It is responsible for cell shape, internal organization, movement, and mechanical strength.
*   **Three Types of Filaments:**
    1.  **Intermediate Filaments:** Ropelike fibers that provide tensile strength and enable cells to withstand mechanical stress.
    2.  **Microtubules:** Stiff, hollow tubes that organize the cytoplasm, form tracks for intracellular transport, and create structures like the mitotic spindle, cilia, and flagella.
    3.  **Actin Filaments:** Thin, flexible threads essential for cell shape, movement, and the formation of contractile structures.

## **II. Intermediate Filaments**
*   **Structure and Function:** They are the toughest and most durable cytoskeletal filaments. They form a network throughout the cytoplasm and also compose the **nuclear lamina**, a meshwork that strengthens the nuclear envelope.
*   **Assembly:** Monomers pair to form dimers, which then associate in a staggered, antiparallel fashion to form tetramers. Tetramers link together end-to-end and side-to-side to form the final ropelike filament. Because the tetramer subunit is symmetrical, the final filament lacks polarity.
*   **Classes:** Include **keratins** in epithelial cells, **vimentin** in connective tissue, **neurofilaments** in nerve cells, and **lamins** in the nucleus.

## **III. Microtubules**
*   **Structure and Polarity:** Hollow tubes made of globular **tubulin** subunits. They are built from 13 parallel protofilaments, each a chain of alternating α- and β-tubulin. This structure has a distinct polarity, with a fast-growing **plus end** and a slow-growing **minus end**.
*   **Dynamic Instability:** Microtubules undergo rapid cycles of growth and shrinkage, a property called dynamic instability. This is driven by GTP hydrolysis. GTP-bound tubulin dimers add to the growing end, but once incorporated, the GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP. GDP-bound tubulin binds less tightly, favoring disassembly.
*   **Organization:** Microtubules grow out from a **microtubule-organizing center (MTOC)**, such as the **centrosome** in animal cells. The minus ends are anchored in the MTOC, while the plus ends radiate outwards.
*   **Motor Proteins:** **Kinesins** and **dyneins** are motor proteins that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to move along microtubules. Most kinesins move toward the plus end, while dyneins move toward the minus end. They transport organelles, vesicles, and other cargo.
*   **Cilia and Flagella:** Hairlike appendages containing a core of stable microtubules in a "9 + 2" arrangement. Their bending movement is driven by the motor protein **ciliary dynein**.

## **IV. Actin Filaments**
*   **Structure and Polarity:** Thin, flexible helical polymers of the protein **actin**. Like microtubules, they are polar, with a faster-growing plus end and a slower-growing minus end.
*   **Assembly and Treadmilling:** Actin monomers carrying ATP add to the filament. The ATP is then hydrolyzed to ADP, which destabilizes the filament. At intermediate monomer concentrations, filaments can undergo **treadmilling**, where monomers are added at the plus end and removed from the minus end simultaneously.
*   **Cell Cortex and Movement:** A concentrated network of actin filaments just beneath the plasma membrane, called the **cell cortex**, controls cell shape and movement. Cell crawling is driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge (forming **lamellipodia** and **filopodia**) and contraction at the rear.
*   **Actin-Binding Proteins:** A vast number of these proteins regulate the behavior of actin filaments, organizing them into bundles or networks, controlling their polymerization, and linking them to other structures.
*   **Myosin:** A family of motor proteins that move along actin filaments. **Myosin-I** is found in all cell types. **Myosin-II** is a dimer that can assemble into bipolar **myosin filaments**.

## **V. Muscle Contraction**
*   **Sliding-Filament Mechanism:** Muscle contraction results from the sliding of actin filaments against myosin-II filaments.
*   **Sarcomeres:** The contractile units of muscle, consisting of a highly organized array of overlapping actin (thin) and myosin-II (thick) filaments.
*   **Contraction Trigger:** A sudden rise in cytosolic Ca²⁺, released from the **sarcoplasmic reticulum** in response to a nerve signal, initiates contraction.
*   **Regulation:** The Ca²⁺ binds to **troponin**, a protein complex associated with **tropomyosin** on the actin filament. This binding causes tropomyosin to shift its position, exposing the myosin-binding sites on the actin filament and allowing the myosin heads to attach and drive filament sliding.
