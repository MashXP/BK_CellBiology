# Cell Signaling Study Guide

## 1. Principles of Cell Signaling

### 1.1 Signal Transduction
*   **Definition:** The process whereby one type of signal is converted into another.
*   **Mechanism:** A target cell converts an extracellular signal molecule into an intracellular signaling molecule to produce a specific cellular response.
*   **Analogy:** Similar to how a mobile phone converts a radio signal into sound waves.
*   **Example:** Yeast cells change shape (shmooing) in response to mating factors.

### 1.2 Forms of Signaling in Animal Cells
*   **Endocrine:** Signaling molecules (**hormones**) are secreted by endocrine cells into the bloodstream to reach distant target cells (e.g., Insulin, Cortisol).
*   **Paracrine:** Signaling molecules (**local mediators**) diffuse locally through the extracellular fluid to nearby cells (e.g., Histamine, Growth Factors).
*   **Neuronal:** Electrical signals trigger the release of **neurotransmitters** at synapses to reach specific target cells (e.g., Acetylcholine).
*   **Contact-dependent:** Membrane-bound signal molecules bind directly to receptors on adjacent cells (e.g., Delta).

### 1.3 Signaling Molecules
*   **Hormones:**
    *   **Adrenaline (Epinephrine):** Derivative of the amino acid tyrosine.
    *   **Cortisol, Estradiol, Testosterone:** Steroids (derivatives of cholesterol).
    *   **Thyroid hormone (Thyroxine):** Derivative of the amino acid tyrosine.
    *   **Insulin:** Protein.
*   **Local Mediators:** Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Platelet-derived Growth Factor (PDGF), Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Histamine.
    *   **Nitric Oxide (NO):** Dissolved gas.
*   **Neurotransmitters:** Acetylcholine, GABA.
*   **Contact-dependent:** Delta (transmembrane protein).

## 2. Signal Reception and Response

### 2.1 Receptor Types
*   **Cell-Surface Receptors:** Bind large or hydrophilic signal molecules that cannot cross the plasma membrane.
*   **Intracellular Receptors:** Bind small, hydrophobic signal molecules that can diffuse across the plasma membrane (e.g., steroid hormones like Cortisol, Testosterone) to bind receptors in the cytosol or nucleus.

### 2.2 Response Specificity
*   **Different Responses to Same Signal:** The same signal molecule can induce different responses depending on the target cell's machinery.
    *   **Acetylcholine Example:**
        *   *Heart pacemaker cell:* Decreased rate of firing.
        *   *Salivary gland cell:* Secretion.
        *   *Skeletal muscle cell:* Contraction.
*   **Combinatorial Signaling:** Cells require specific combinations of signals to survive, grow, divide, or differentiate. If deprived of necessary survival signals, the cell typically undergoes apoptosis (death).

### 2.3 Response Timing
*   **Fast (< sec to mins):** Involves altered protein function (e.g., changes in cell movement, secretion, metabolism). Does not require new protein synthesis.
*   **Slow (mins to hrs):** Involves altered protein synthesis via changes in gene expression.

## 3. Intracellular Signaling Pathways

### 3.1 Pathway Organization
*   **Process:** Extracellular signal -> Receptor protein -> Intracellular signaling molecules -> Effector proteins -> Target cell response.
*   **Effector Proteins:**
    *   **Metabolic enzymes:** Alter metabolism.
    *   **Cytoskeletal proteins:** Alter cell shape or movement.
    *   **Transcription regulators:** Alter gene expression.

### 3.2 Functions of Intracellular Signaling Proteins
*   **Relay:** Pass the signal to the next component in the chain.
*   **Amplify:** Make the signal stronger, so a few extracellular molecules can evoke a large response.
*   **Integrate:** Receive signals from multiple pathways and merge them before relaying.
*   **Distribute:** Spread the signal to more than one effector pathway.
*   **Modulate (Feedback):** Regulate the activity of upstream components.

### 3.3 Feedback Regulation
*   **Positive Feedback:** A downstream component acts on an upstream component to enhance the response.
*   **Negative Feedback:** A downstream component acts on an upstream component to diminish the response.

## 4. Molecular Switches

Many intracellular signaling proteins act as molecular switches, toggling between an active ("on") and inactive ("off") state.

### 4.1 Signaling by Protein Phosphorylation
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   **Protein Kinase:** Adds a phosphate group (from ATP) to the protein, turning it ON (usually).
    *   **Protein Phosphatase:** Removes the phosphate group, turning the protein OFF.
*   **Cycle:** Signal In -> Kinase phosphorylates -> ON -> Signal Out -> Phosphatase dephosphorylates -> OFF.

### 4.2 Signaling by GTP-Binding Proteins
*   **Mechanism:** Toggle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state.
    *   **GTP Binding:** Activates the protein (ON).
    *   **GTP Hydrolysis:** The protein hydrolyzes bound GTP to GDP, switching itself OFF.
*   **Regulation of Monomeric GTPases:**
    *   **GEF (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor):** Activates the protein by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP.
    *   **GAP (GTPase Activating Protein):** Inactivates the protein by stimulating the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP.

## 5. Classes of Cell-Surface Receptors

Cell-surface receptors generally fall into three main classes:

1.  **Ion-channel-coupled receptors:** Change the permeability of the plasma membrane to selected ions, thereby altering the membrane potential and, if the conditions are right, producing an electrical current.
2.  **G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs):** Activate membrane-bound, trimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), which then activate (or inhibit) an enzyme or an ion channel in the plasma membrane, initiating an intracellular signaling cascade.
3.  **Enzyme-coupled receptors:** Act as enzymes or associate with enzymes inside the cell; when stimulated, the enzymes can activate a wide variety of intracellular signaling pathways.

### 5.1 Foreign Substances Acting on Receptors
Many drugs and poisons act on these receptors:
*   **Barbiturates/Benzodiazepines:** Stimulate GABA-activated ion-channel-coupled receptors (Relief of anxiety, sedation).
*   **Nicotine:** Stimulates acetylcholine-activated ion-channel-coupled receptors (Constriction of blood vessels, BP elevation).
*   **Morphine/Heroin:** Stimulate G-protein-coupled opiate receptors (Analgesia, euphoria).
*   **Curare:** Blocks acetylcholine-activated ion-channel-coupled receptors (Paralysis).
*   **Strychnine:** Blocks glycine-activated ion-channel-coupled receptors (Seizures, muscle spasm).
*   **Capsaicin:** Stimulates temperature-sensitive ion-channel-coupled receptors (Pain, burning sensation).
*   **Menthol:** Stimulates cold-sensitive ion-channel-coupled receptors (Cool sensation).

## 6. G-Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)

### 6.1 Structure and Activation
*   **Structure:** All GPCRs possess a similar structure comprising seven transmembrane $\alpha$-helices.
*   **Activation Mechanism:**
    1.  Extracellular signal molecule binds to the GPCR.
    2.  Receptor undergoes a conformational change.
    3.  Activated receptor acts as a GEF for the associated G protein, encouraging the $\alpha$ subunit to expel GDP and pick up GTP.
    4.  The G protein dissociates into an activated $\alpha$ subunit (with GTP) and an activated $\beta\gamma$ complex. Both can interact with target proteins.
*   **Inactivation:** The $\alpha$ subunit has intrinsic GTPase activity. It hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP (switches off) and reassociates with the $\beta\gamma$ complex to reform the inactive G protein.

### 6.2 GPCR Effects
GPCRs can regulate ion channels or enzymes.

*   **Regulating Ion Channels:**
    *   *Example:* In heart pacemaker cells, Acetylcholine activates a Gi protein. The $\beta\gamma$ complex binds to and opens K+ channels, making the membrane harder to activate and slowing the heart rate.
*   **Regulating Enzymes (Second Messengers):**
    *   G proteins activate enzymes that produce small intracellular signaling molecules (**second messengers**).
    *   These molecules diffuse to act on intracellular signaling proteins.

### 6.3 The Cyclic AMP (cAMP) Pathway
*   **Synthesis:** **Adenylyl cyclase** converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP).
*   **Degradation:** **Cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase** converts cAMP to AMP.
*   **Dynamics:** cAMP concentration can rise rapidly (e.g., in nerve cells responding to serotonin, visible as a color change in experimental visuals).
*   **Major Responses Mediated by cAMP:**
    *   **Epinephrine (Heart):** Increases heart rate and force of contraction.
    *   **Epinephrine (Skeletal Muscle):** Glycogen breakdown.
    *   **Epinephrine/Glucagon (Fat):** Fat breakdown.
    *   **ACTH (Adrenal Gland):** Cortisol secretion.

## 7. GPCR Pathways: Downstream Effects

### 7.1 Epinephrine Pathway (Glycogen Breakdown)
*   **Signal:** Epinephrine binds to GPCR (Adrenergic receptor).
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Activates Gs protein ($\\alpha$ subunit).
    2.  Activates **Adenylyl cyclase** $\\rightarrow$ produces cAMP.
    3.  cAMP activates **PKA (Protein Kinase A)**.
    4.  PKA phosphorylates **Phosphorylase kinase**.
    5.  Phosphorylase kinase phosphorylates **Glycogen phosphorylase**.
    6.  **Glycogen breakdown** occurs.

### 7.2 Gene Transcription Activation
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Rise in intracellular cAMP activates PKA.
    2.  Activated PKA enters the nucleus.
    3.  PKA phosphorylates specific transcription regulators.
    4.  Stimulates the transcription of target genes.
*   **Significance:** Converts a short-term signal into a long-term change in the cell (e.g., hormone synthesis, memory formation).

### 7.3 The Phospholipase C Pathway
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  GPCR activates Gq protein.
    2.  Activates **Phospholipase C**.
    3.  Cleaves an inositol phospholipid into two second messengers:
        *   **IP3 (Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate):** Soluble; diffuses to the ER and opens Ca2+ channels.
        *   **DAG (Diacylglycerol):** Membrane-bound; recruits and activates **PKC (Protein Kinase C)** (requires Ca2+).
*   **Specific Tissue Targets and Responses:**
    *   **Vasopressin (Liver):** Glycogen breakdown.
    *   **Acetylcholine (Pancreas):** Secretion of amylase (digestive enzyme).
    *   **Thrombin (Blood Platelets):** Aggregation.

### 7.4 Calcium (Ca2+) as an Intracellular Signal
*   **Trigger:** Fertilization (sperm entry) triggers a massive increase in cytosolic Ca2+.
*   **Calmodulin:** A ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein.
    *   When Ca2+ binds, Calmodulin changes shape and wraps around target proteins (like CaM-kinases) to alter their activity.
*   **Nitric Oxide (NO) Signaling:**
    *   Acetylcholine $\\rightarrow$ GPCR $\\rightarrow$ IP3 $\\rightarrow$ Ca2+ release in endothelial cells.
    *   Ca2+ activates **NO synthase (NOS)** to produce NO from arginine.
    *   NO diffuses into adjacent smooth muscle cells.
    *   NO binds to **Guanylyl cyclase** $\\rightarrow$ produces **cGMP**.
    *   Result: Rapid relaxation of smooth muscle (vasodilation).

### 7.5 Rod Photoreceptors (Signal Amplification)
*   **Signal:** Light (photons).
*   **Pathway:**
    1.  **Rhodopsin** absorbs one photon.
    2.  Activates 500 **Transducin** (G protein) molecules.
    3.  Activates 500 **cGMP phosphodiesterase** molecules.
    4.  Hydrolyzes 10^5 cGMP molecules.
    5.  Closes 250 cation channels.
    6.  Membrane potential alters by 1 mV $\\rightarrow$ Signal to brain.
*   **Key Concept:** Massive amplification allows extreme sensitivity to light.

## 8. Enzyme-Coupled Receptors

### 8.1 Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs)
*   **Structure:** Single transmembrane segment.
*   **Activation:**
    1.  Signal molecule (often a dimer) binds to two receptor chains, causing them to dimerize.
    2.  **Cross-phosphorylation:** The kinase domains phosphorylate each other on specific tyrosines.
    3.  **Signaling Complex Assembly:** Phosphorylated tyrosines serve as docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins (e.g., adaptor proteins).

### 8.2 RTK-Ras Pathway
*   **Ras:** A small, monomeric GTPase anchored to the membrane.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Activated RTK recruits an adaptor protein.
    2.  Adaptor recruits **Ras-GEF**.
    3.  Ras-GEF stimulates Ras to exchange GDP for GTP (activation).
    4.  Activated Ras initiates a phosphorylation cascade (MAP-kinase module).
*   **MAP-Kinase Module:**
    *   Ras $\\rightarrow$ MAP kinase kinase kinase $\\rightarrow$ MAP kinase kinase $\\rightarrow$ MAP kinase.
    *   **MAP Kinase** phosphorylates effector proteins (transcription regulators, other proteins) to control cell division, differentiation, etc.

## 9. RTK Pathways: PI-3-Kinase-Akt Signaling

### 9.1 PI-3-Kinase-Akt Pathway
*   **Initiation:** Activated RTK activates **PI 3-kinase**.
*   **Phosphorylation:** PI 3-kinase phosphorylates inositol phospholipids in the plasma membrane.
*   **Akt Activation:** These phosphorylated lipids serve as docking sites for intracellular signaling proteins, including **Akt (Protein Kinase B)** and Protein Kinase 1. Akt is activated by phosphorylation.
*   **Signal Relay:** Activated Akt relays the signal onward.

### 9.2 Akt's Role in Cell Survival and Growth
*   **Cell Survival:** Activated Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins like **Bad**. This releases **Bcl2**, which inhibits apoptosis.
*   **Cell Growth:** Akt stimulates cells to grow in size by activating **Tor (serine/threonine kinase)**. Tor promotes cell growth by inhibiting protein degradation and stimulating protein synthesis.

## 10. Research Techniques in Signaling

### 10.1 Using Mutant Proteins
*   **Purpose:** To determine the exact binding site of an intracellular signaling molecule on a receptor.
*   **Method:** Create mutant receptors with specific tyrosine residues changed to phenylalanine (which cannot be phosphorylated). Observe which signaling molecules fail to bind.

### 10.2 Using Mutant Cell Lines and Overactive Proteins
*   **Purpose:** To dissect the order of proteins in an intracellular signaling pathway.
*   **Method (Example using Ras, Protein X, Protein Y):**
    *   If introducing overactive Ras restores signaling in a cell mutant for protein X, then Ras acts downstream of protein X.
    *   If introducing overactive Ras has no effect in a cell mutant for protein Y, then protein Y acts downstream of Ras.
*   **Deducing Pathway Order:** Signal -> Receptor -> Protein X -> Ras -> Protein Y -> Cellular Response.

## 11. Other Signaling Mechanisms

### 11.1 Notch Signaling (Drosophila Example)
*   **Context:** Controls nerve-cell production through **lateral inhibition**.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Unspecified epithelial cells.
    2.  One cell begins to develop as a nerve cell.
    3.  This developing nerve cell expresses a membrane-bound inhibitory signal protein (**Delta**).
    4.  Delta binds to the **Notch receptor** on neighboring epithelial cells.
    5.  Notch binding leads to its cleavage, and the cleaved Notch tail migrates to the nucleus.
    6.  The Notch tail acts as a transcription regulator, activating the transcription of Notch-responsive genes, which inhibit the neighboring cells from becoming nerve cells.

### 11.2 Intracellular Receptor Signaling (Steroid Hormones)
*   **Ligands:** Small, hydrophobic hormones like cortisol, estradiol, testosterone, and thyroxine.
*   **Mechanism (Cortisol Example):**
    1.  Cortisol diffuses across the plasma membrane.
    2.  Binds to a nuclear receptor protein (intracellular receptor) in the cytosol.
    3.  Receptor undergoes a conformational change, activating it.
    4.  The activated receptor-cortisol complex moves into the nucleus.
    5.  Binds to specific regulatory regions of target DNA.
    6.  Activates transcription of target genes.

### 11.3 Ethylene Signaling (Plants)
*   **Mechanism:** Regulates gene expression by relieving inhibition.
    *   **Absence of Ethylene:** An active ethylene receptor activates a protein kinase, which phosphorylates and leads to the degradation of a transcription regulator. Ethylene-responsive genes are OFF.
    *   **Presence of Ethylene:** Ethylene binds to and inactivates the ethylene receptor. The protein kinase becomes inactive, preventing the degradation of the transcription regulator. The active transcription regulator then promotes the transcription of ethylene-responsive genes.

## 12. Integrated Signaling

### 12.1 Integration of Incoming Signals
*   Intracellular signaling proteins often integrate multiple incoming signals.
*   Various signals can converge to activate or inhibit different downstream pathways, leading to a coordinated cellular response.
