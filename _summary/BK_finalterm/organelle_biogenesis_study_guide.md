# Organelle Biogenesis, Differentiation, and Apoptosis Study Guide

## 1. Genomic Equivalence and Totipotency

### 1.1 The Principle of Genomic Equivalence
* **Concept:** Differentiated cells contain all the genetic instructions needed to direct the formation of a complete organism. Differentiation involves changes in gene expression, not the loss of DNA.

### 1.2 Experimental Evidence (Cloning)
* **Amphibian Cloning (Frogs):**
    * The nucleus of a differentiated skin cell from an adult frog is injected into an enucleated (nucleus destroyed by UV) unfertilized egg.
    * This can result in a normal embryo and eventually a tadpole, proving the skin cell nucleus retained all necessary genetic information.
    * **Plant Cloning (Carrots):**
    * A single cell separated from a carrot can proliferate in a rich liquid medium to form a clone of dividing cells.
    * These cells can organize into a young embryo and eventually develop into a complete young plant (carrot), demonstrating totipotency.
* **Mammalian Cloning (Cows):**
    * Epithelial cells from the oviduct of a donor cow are fused with an enucleated unfertilized egg cell using an electric pulse.
    * The reconstructed zygote develops into an embryo, which is placed in a foster mother to produce a calf genetically identical to the donor.

## 2. Regulation of Gene Expression

### 2.1 Steps of Control
Gene expression in eukaryotic cells is controlled at multiple steps to regulate cell function and differentiation:
1.  **Transcriptional control:** DNA to RNA transcript.
2.  **RNA processing control:** RNA transcript to mRNA.
3.  **mRNA transport and localization control:** Nucleus to Cytosol.
4.  **mRNA degradation control:** Regulating mRNA stability.
5.  **Translation control:** mRNA to protein.
6.  **Protein degradation control:** Regulating protein turnover.
7.  **Protein activity control:** Active vs. inactive protein states.

## 3. Cell Differentiation and Fate

### 3.1 Cellular Morphology and Function
* **Origin Reflection:** Cells in culture often display distinct properties reflecting their tissue of origin (e.g., morphology of fibroblasts vs. epithelial cells).
* **Genome vs. Phenotype:** A neuron and a liver cell share the exact same genome but exhibit drastically different structures and functions due to differential gene expression.

### 3.2 Combinatorial Control
* **Mechanism:** A small number of transcription regulators can generate many distinct cell types during development.
* **Process:** A precursor cell undergoes division. At each stage, specific regulatory proteins (e.g., Protein 1, 2, 3) are made. Different combinations of these proteins determine the final cell type (e.g., Cell type A has proteins 1 and 3; Cell type G has proteins 1 and 2).

### 3.3 Reprogramming and Pluripotency
* **iPS Cells (Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells):**
    * Differentiated cells (e.g., fibroblasts) can be reprogrammed into a pluripotent state by introducing specific genes.
    * **Key Transcription Factors:** **Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4** form a regulatory network that specifies embryonic stem cell identity.
    * **Potential:** iPS cells can differentiate into smooth muscle cells, neurons, or fat cells when cultured under specific conditions.
* **Direct Conversion:** A small number of transcription regulators can convert one differentiated cell type directly into another (e.g., fibroblast to neuron) without passing through a pluripotent state.
* **Master Regulators:** A single master transcription regulator can trigger the formation of an entire organ. For example, ectopic expression can induce the formation of an eye structure on a fly's leg.

## 4. Stem Cells and Hematopoiesis

### 4.1 Hematopoietic Lineage
* **Origin:** All blood cells originate from a **Multipotential Hematopoietic Stem Cell (Hemocytoblast)**.
* **Lineages:**
    * **Common Myeloid Progenitor:** Gives rise to Erythrocytes, Mast cells, Myeloblasts (leading to Basophils, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Monocytes), and Megakaryocytes (leading to Thrombocytes).
    * **Common Lymphoid Progenitor:** Gives rise to Natural Killer cells and Small Lymphocytes (which differentiate into T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes -> Plasma cells).

## 5. Plant Development and Meristems

### 5.1 Meristems
* **Function:** Plants maintain populations of stem cells in **Shoot Apical Meristems** and **Root Apical Meristems**.
* **Division:** When a stem cell divides, one daughter cell remains meristematic (stem cell) while the other contributes to growth and differentiation.
* **Zones:**
    * **Shoot Meristem:** Contains a central zone (stem cells), peripheral zone (organ initiation), and rib meristem.
    * **Root Meristem:** Contains a quiescent center and stem cells.

### 5.2 Plant Plasticity and Signaling
* **Reprogramming:** Plants have high plasticity. Differentiated cells (epidermal, root hair) can regenerate shoots, roots, or form tracheary elements.
* **Callus Formation:** Differentiated cells can de-differentiate into **protoplasts** and form a **callus** (mass of undifferentiated cells), which can then regenerate a shoot.
* **CLE Peptide Signaling:**
    * Signaling peptides like **CLV3** (Clavata3) and **WUS** (Wuschel) regulate the balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation in the shoot meristem.
    * Interaction involves CLV3 binding to CLV1/CLV2 receptors to inhibit WUS expression, maintaining meristem size.
    * **Xylogen** and **CLE peptides** (e.g., CLE 41, 42) regulate vascular stem cells.

## 6. Cell Memory and Epigenetics

### 6.1 Mechanisms of Inheritance
Cells maintain their identity through division via several mechanisms:
* **Positive Feedback Loops:** A transient signal turns on a "master" gene (Gene A). Protein A then activates its own transcription. Even after the signal disappears, Gene A continues to be transcribed in progeny cells due to the accumulated Protein A.
* **DNA Methylation:**
    * Methylation occurs on **cytosine** bases (forming **5-methylcytosine**), typically in CG sequences.
    * **Maintenance Methyltransferase:** During replication, this enzyme recognizes hemimethylated DNA (one strand methylated) and methylates the newly synthesized strand, faithfully inheriting the pattern.
* **Histone Modification:** Parental nucleosomes with modified histones are distributed to daughter chromosomes. Enzymes recognize these modifications and re-establish the same pattern on nearby new histones.

## 7. Apoptosis (Programmed Cell Death)

### 7.1 Characteristics and Function
* **Definition:** A controlled, neat process where cells shrink, chromatin condenses, and the nucleus collapses. The cell breaks into **apoptotic bodies** which are engulfed by phagocytes.
* **Contrast with Necrosis:** Apoptotic cells die quickly and cleanly without lysing and damaging neighbors, unlike necrosis.
* **Developmental Roles:**
    * **Sculpting:** Apoptosis eliminates cells between developing digits (mouse paw) to separate them.
    * **Metamorphosis:** Induces the loss of the tail as a tadpole changes into a frog.
    * **Neural Development:** Adjusts the number of nerve cells to match the number of target cells; nerve cells that don't receive enough survival factor undergo apoptosis.

### 7.2 The Caspase Cascade
* **Mechanism:** Apoptosis is mediated by an intracellular proteolytic cascade.
    * **Initiator Procaspases:** Activated by dimerization and cleavage via adaptor proteins in response to apoptotic stimuli.
    * **Executioner Caspases:** Activated by initiator caspases; they cleave multiple substrates to dismantle the cell.

### 7.3 Pathways of Apoptosis
* **Intrinsic Pathway (Mitochondrial):**
    * Triggered by intracellular stress (chemicals, radiation).
    * **Cytochrome c Release:** **Bax** and **Bak** (pro-apoptotic proteins) release cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
    * **Apoptosome:** Cytochrome c binds to adaptor proteins (**Apaf-1**), assembling into a wheel-like **apoptosome**.
    * **Caspase-9:** The apoptosome recruits and activates Procaspase-9, triggering the cascade.
* **Extrinsic Pathway:**
    * Triggered by extracellular lethal stimuli binding to **Death Receptors** (e.g., Fas, TNFRI).
    * **DISC Complex:** Adaptor proteins (FADD) recruit and activate **Caspase-8** (or 10), leading to apoptosis.

### 7.4 Regulation
* **Bcl2 Family:**
    * **Pro-apoptotic:** Bax, Bak, Bid, BH3-only proteins.
    * **Anti-apoptotic:** **Bcl2**, Bcl-XL. They block apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release.
* **IAPs (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins):** Block caspases (e.g., XIAP). They are countered by **SMAC** (released from mitochondria).
* **Survival Factors:** Suppress apoptosis by activating pathways that increase **Bcl2** expression or inhibit pro-apoptotic proteins.

### 7.5 Growth Factors and Cell Growth
* Extracellular growth factors activate Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) $\rightarrow$ PI 3-kinase $\rightarrow$ Akt $\rightarrow$ **Tor**.
* **Tor** stimulates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation, leading to cell growth.
