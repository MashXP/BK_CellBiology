# Meiosis, Fertilization, and Genetics Study Guide

## 1. Sexual Reproduction Fundamentals

### 1.1 Modes of Reproduction
* **Asexual Reproduction:** Organisms like the hydra reproduce by budding.
* **Sexual Reproduction:** Involves both haploid and diploid cells.
    * **Genetic Contribution:** Despite the tremendous difference in size between the sperm and egg, they contribute equally to the genetic character of the offspring.

### 1.2 Cell Lineages
* **Differentiation of Function:** Germ-line cells and somatic cells carry out fundamentally different functions.
    * **Somatic Cells:** Diploid body cells that form the organism.
    * **Germ-line Cells:** Diploid precursor cells that undergo meiosis to produce haploid gametes (sperm and egg).


## 2. Comparison of Meiosis and Mitosis

### 2.1 Starting Mechanism
* **Chromosome Duplication:** Both mitosis and meiosis begin with a round of chromosome duplication, turning a $2N$ nucleus into a $4N$ state.

### 2.2 Key Differences
* **Division Rounds:**
    * **Mitosis:** Involves one cell division.
    * **Meiosis:** Involves two successive cell divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II).
* **Outcomes:**
    * **Mitosis:** Produces two genetically identical diploid nuclei.
    * **Meiosis:** Produces four genetically nonidentical haploid nuclei.
* **Occurrence:**
    * **Mitosis:** Occurs in somatic/body cells for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction.
    * **Meiosis:** Occurs in reproductive cells (germ-line) for sexual reproduction and gamete production.

## 3. Mechanisms of Meiosis I

### 3.1 Pairing and Alignment
* **Paternal and Maternal Homologs:** During Meiosis I, duplicated homologous chromosomes pair up before lining up on the meiotic spindle.
    * This contrasts with mitosis, where chromosomes line up individually.
* **Bivalents:** The structure formed by the pairing of duplicated maternal and paternal chromosomes is called a bivalent.
    * A bivalent contains four chromatids.

### 3.2 Recombination (Crossing-Over)
* **Process:** Non-sister chromatids in each bivalent swap segments of DNA.
* **Molecular Steps:**
    1.  **Double-Strand Break:** Produced by recombination proteins in one of the chromatids.
    2.  **Nuclease Digestion:** A nuclease digests the 5' ends.
    3.  **Strand Exchange:** One strand invades the other DNA helix.
    4.  **Synthesis and Ligation:** Additional DNA synthesis and ligation capture the second strand, resulting in a crossover.


### 3.3 The Synaptonemal Complex
* **Function:** Helps to align the duplicated homolog pairs.
* **Structure:** Consists of **axial cores** (containing cohesin) linked by **transverse filaments**, spanning a distance of roughly $100~\text{nm}$.

### 3.4 Chiasmata and Segregation
* **Chiasmata:** Crossover events create physical connections called chiasmata between non-sister chromatids.
    * Multiple crossovers can occur in a single bivalent.
* **Function in Segregation:** Chiasmata help ensure proper segregation during the first meiotic division.
    * **Kinetochores:** In Meiosis I, kinetochores on sister chromatids function as a **single unit** and point in the same direction.
    * **Separation:** The arms of sister chromatids become unglued, allowing homologs to separate while sister chromatids remain attached.

## 4. Mechanisms of Meiosis II

### 4.1 Chromosome Behavior
* **Kinetochores:** In Meiosis II, the kinetochores on each sister chromatid function **independently** (similar to mitosis).
* **Separation:** Cohesins at the centromere are degraded, allowing sister chromatids to separate and be pulled to opposite poles.

## 5. Genetic Variation and Inheritance

### 5.1 Sources of Genetic Variation
1.  **Independent Assortment:** Maternal and paternal homologs align randomly on the spindle during Metaphase I.
    * This explains Mendel's law of independent assortment.
2.  **Crossing-Over:** Occurs during meiotic prophase, creating new combinations of alleles on chromosomes.
3.  **Fertilization:** The fusion of genetically unique gametes.

### 5.2 Chromosome Segregation Errors
* **Nondisjunction:** Errors in segregation can result in gametes with incorrect numbers of chromosomes (aneuploidy).
    * **Down Syndrome:** Can result from gametes with 2 copies of Chromosome 21 (due to nondisjunction in Meiosis I), leading to a zygote with three copies.

## 6. Mendelian Genetics

### 6.1 History and Experiments
* **Historical Context:** Before modern genetics, one disproven theory of inheritance suggested that genetic traits were passed down solely from the father.
* **Mendel’s Work:** Gregor Mendel disproved this by showing traits are inherited in a discrete fashion.
* **Traits:** Mendel studied seven traits in peas (e.g., pea shape, flower color).
* **Dominance:** Traits have dominant forms (e.g., yellow pea, round shape) and recessive forms (e.g., green pea, wrinkled shape).
* **Human Examples:** Similar dominant/recessive patterns exist in humans, such as the ability to taste specific substances (e.g., "some people taste it, some people don't").
* **True-Breeding:** When true-breeding varieties (homozygous) are crossed, the offspring ($F_1$) all resemble the dominant parent (e.g., 100% yellow peas).

### 6.2 Laws of Inheritance
* **Gamete Formation:** Parent plants produce gametes that each contain one allele for each trait.
    * The phenotype of the offspring depends entirely on which combination of alleles it receives.
* **Law of Segregation:** Alleles segregate from each other during gamete formation.
    * **$F_2$ Generation Genotypes:** Self-fertilization of the $F_1$ generation (genotype $Yy$) results in a specific genotypic ratio:
        * 25% Homozygous Dominant ($YY$).
        * 50% Heterozygous ($Yy$ or $yY$).
        * 25% Homozygous Recessive ($yy$).
    * **Phenotypic Ratio:** This results in 75% normally pigmented (or dominant trait) and 25% albino (or recessive trait) offspring.
* **Law of Independent Assortment:** Demonstrated by dihybrid crosses (two traits). Alleles for different traits segregate independently.

## 7. Pedigrees and Populations

### 7.1 Pedigree Analysis
* **Usage:** Pedigrees show inheritance patterns and risks, such as in first-cousin marriages (consanguinity).
    * Consanguineous marriage increases the prevalence of inheriting disease-causing alleles.

### 7.2 Complex Traits
* **Geographic Prevalence:** Complex diseases (like obesity) are widespread and common, often involving interaction between multiple genes and the environment.

## 8. Genetic Mapping and Linkage

### 8.1 Linkage
* **Independent vs. Linked:** Genes far apart on a chromosome segregate independently (due to frequent crossovers), while genes close together ("linked") do not segregate independently as crossover is unlikely between them.

### 8.2 Mapping
* **Map Units:** If two genes are reassorted in $x\%$ of gametes, they are separated by a genetic map distance of $x$ map units (centimorgans).

## 9. Mutations and Screens

### 9.1 Types of Mutations
Mutations in protein-coding genes affect the product in various ways:
* **Loss-of-function:** Usually recessive.
* **Gain-of-function:** Usually dominant.
* **Molecular Changes:** DNA-damaging agents (mutagens) can cause nucleotide substitutions, insertions, or deletions.

### 9.2 Complementation Tests
* **Purpose:** To determine if two recessive mutations producing the same phenotype are in the same gene or different genes.
* **Visual Example:** This logic is used to study phenotypes such as plumage color in birds, where identical abnormal phenotypes (e.g., white plumage vs. colored) can be caused by mutations in completely different genes.
* **Complementation:** Offspring are normal $\rightarrow$ Mutations are in **two different** genes.
* **Noncomplementation:** Offspring are mutant $\rightarrow$ Mutations are in the **same** gene.


### 9.3 Genetic Screens
* **Organisms:** Screens are performed on organisms like *C. elegans* to identify mutations affecting behavior or physiology.
* **RNA Interference (RNAi):** A method for genome-wide screens where organisms ingest bacteria expressing dsRNA to silence specific genes.
* **Temperature-Sensitive Mutants:** Useful for studying essential genes. Mutants grow at a permissive temperature ($23^{\circ}\text{C}$) but fail at a nonpermissive temperature ($36^{\circ}\text{C}$).

## 10. Human Genetics and GWAS

### 10.1 SNPs and Association
* **SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms):** Common DNA variations used to track disease genes.
* **Linkage Analysis:** If a specific SNP (e.g., genotype $aa$) is consistently co-inherited with a disease, the disease mutation likely lies close to that SNP.
* **GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies):** Identify DNA variations significantly more frequent in people with specific diseases (e.g., age-related macular degeneration) compared to healthy controls.
