# Cytoskeleton Study Guide

## 1. Principles of the Cytoskeleton

### 1.1 Definition and Function
* **Definition:** An intricate network of protein filaments that extends throughout the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.
* **Key Functions:**
    * **Organization:** Organizes components in the cellular interior.
    * **Transport:** Provides machinery for transport between organelles and for chromosome segregation.
    * **Shape:** Allows the cell to adopt specific shapes (e.g., during embryonic development) and interact mechanically with the environment.
    * **Movement:** Facilitates large-scale movements like cell crawling, muscle contraction, and sperm movement.
* **Dynamic Nature:** It is a highly dynamic structure that is continuously reorganized as the cell changes shape, divides, or responds to the environment.

### 1.2 Main Protein Filaments
The cytoskeleton consists of three main types of protein filaments:
1.  **Intermediate Filaments:** Ropelike fibers (10 nm diameter) providing mechanical strength and distributing mechanical stresses.
2.  **Microtubules:** Hollow cylinders (25 nm outer diameter) made of tubulin. They are rigid and rupture when stretched.
3.  **Actin Filaments:** Helical polymers (7 nm diameter) made of actin, often concentrated in the cortex.

## 2. Intermediate Filaments

### 2.1 Structure and Assembly
* **Appearance:** Ropelike fibers with a diameter of roughly 10 nm.
* **Monomer:** An elongated fibrous protein with an N-terminal head, C-terminal tail, and a central $\alpha$-helical rod domain. The head and tail domains are unstructured and exposed on the surface to interact with specific cellular components, while the central $\alpha$-helical rod domain is similar in size across different proteins.
* **Assembly Hierarchy:**
    1.  Two monomers wrap around each other to form a **coiled-coil dimer**.
    2.  Two dimers run in opposite directions to form a **staggered antiparallel tetramer**.
    3.  Tetramers associate laterally (8 tetramers) to form the twisted ropelike filament.
* **Properties:**
    * Both ends of the tetramer are the same (no polarity).
    * Noncovalent bonding and overlapping lateral interactions provide great tensile strength.
    * They are flexible, tough, and durable.
* **Tissue Context:** In epithelial tissue, intermediate filaments traverse the cytoplasm and insert at **desmosomes**, creating a continuous mechanical link from cell to cell.

### 2.2 Classes of Intermediate Filaments
Intermediate filaments are divided into four major classes:
* **Cytoplasmic:**
    1.  **Keratin filaments:** Found in epithelial cells.
    2.  **Vimentin and vimentin-related filaments:** Found in connective tissue, muscle, and glial cells.
    3.  **Neurofilaments:** Found in nerve cells.
* **Nuclear:**
    4.  **Nuclear lamins:** Found in all animal cells.

### 2.3 Clinical Significance and Diseases
* **Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex:** Caused by mutations in keratin genes. The skin becomes highly vulnerable to mechanical injury, causing blistering even under gentle pressure.
* **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS):** Associated with defects in neurofilaments. It is a progressive neurodegenerative disease where motor neurons degenerate, leading to muscle weakness and respiratory failure. (e.g., Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with ALS in his early 20s).
* **Progeria:** A premature aging disorder caused by defects in nuclear lamin. Symptoms include wrinkled skin, hair loss, and severe cardiovascular disease. Mechanisms include nuclear instability, impaired cell division, and potentially altered gene expression.
* **Plectin Defects:** Plectin aids in bundling intermediate filaments and linking them to other networks (e.g., microtubules). Mutations cause diseases combining features of blistering, muscular dystrophy, and neurodegeneration.

### 2.4 The Nuclear Lamina
* **Structure:** A meshwork of intermediate filaments (lamins) lining the inner face of the nuclear envelope.
* **Function:** Provides attachment sites for chromosomes and structural support.
* **Cell Division:** The lamina collapses during mitosis due to **phosphorylation** by kinases and reassembles upon **dephosphorylation** by phosphatases.

### 2.5 Cytoskeletal Integration
* **Bridging Complexes:** Protein complexes (e.g., LINC complexes, which include KASH-domain proteins in the outer nuclear membrane and SUN-domain proteins in the inner nuclear membrane) bridge the nucleus and cytoplasm through the nuclear envelope. They assist in the movement and positioning of the nucleus and the overall organization of the cytoskeleton.

## 3. Microtubules

### 3.1 Structure and Composition
* **Subunits:** Built from tubulin dimers composed of $\alpha$-tubulin and $\beta$-tubulin held by noncovalent interactions.
* **Architecture:** A hollow tube made of 13 parallel protofilaments.
* **Polarity:**
    * **Minus end:** $\alpha$-tubulin end, usually embedded in the centrosome.
    * **Plus end:** $\beta$-tubulin end, extends into the cytoplasm.

### 3.2 Nucleation and the Centrosome
* **Centrosome:** The major microtubule-organizing center in animal cells, located near the nucleus.
* **Structure:** Contains a pair of centrioles surrounded by a matrix containing **$\gamma$-tubulin ring complexes**.
* **Function:** The $\gamma$-tubulin rings serve as nucleation sites (starting points) for microtubule growth.

### 3.3 Dynamic Instability
* **Definition:** Microtubules grow and shrink independently of neighbors; they can shrink partially or disappear completely.
* **Mechanism (GTP Hydrolysis):**
    * **Growth:** Free tubulin dimers carry GTP. If polymerization is rapid, dimers add faster than GTP hydrolyzes, forming a **GTP cap** that stabilizes the end.
    * **Shrinkage:** If GTP hydrolysis catches up, the GTP cap is lost. GDP-bearing dimers bind less tightly, leading to protofilament peeling and disassembly.
* **Stabilization:** A growing microtubule can be stabilized if its plus end attaches to a **capping protein** in the cell cortex.
* **Cell Polarity:** New microtubules explore the cytoplasm. Selective stabilization of microtubules in specific regions biases the array, establishing cell polarity (structurally or functionally different ends).

### 3.4 Drugs Affecting Microtubules
* **Taxol:** Binds tightly to microtubules and prevents them from losing subunits, allowing them to grow but not shrink; arrests dividing cells in mitosis.
* **Colchicine/Colcemid/Vinblastine:** Colchicine binds tightly to free tubulin dimers and prevents their polymerization into microtubules, causing the mitotic spindle to disappear. Vinblastine and Colcemid also bind tubulin dimers and prevent polymerization.
* **Mitotic Spindle:** Cytoplasmic microtubules disassemble and reassemble into the mitotic spindle, which guides chromosomes. Drugs like colchicine cause the spindle to disappear.

### 3.5 Intracellular Transport (Motor Proteins)
Microtubules act as tracks for organelle and vesicle transport. Movement is driven by motor proteins using ATP hydrolysis.
* **Kinesins:** Move toward the **plus end** (outward from cell body).
* **Dyneins:** Move toward the **minus end** (inward toward cell body).
* **Mechanism:** Globular heads bind ATP and microtubules to "walk," while the tail attaches to the cargo either directly or indirectly through adaptor proteins.
* **Organelle Positioning:** Kinesins pull the ER outward; Dyneins pull the Golgi inward toward the nucleus.
* **MAPs:** **Microtubule-Associated Proteins** stabilize microtubules against disassembly, distinct from capping proteins.

### 3.6 Cilia and Flagella
* **Structure:** Hairlike structures containing a core of stable microtubules arranged in a **"9+2" array** (9 outer doublets + 2 central singlets). They grow from a **basal body** (similar to a centriole).
* **Examples:** Respiratory tract lining (cilia), oviduct wall (cilia), sperm (flagella).
* **Movement:** Driven by **ciliary dynein**, which generates bending motion. In isolated doublets, dynein causes sliding; in intact flagella with linking proteins, this sliding converts to bending because the linking proteins prevent filaments from sliding past each other completely.

## 4. Actin Filaments (Microfilaments)

### 4.1 Structure and Dynamics
* **Structure:** Thin, flexible, helical polymers of actin protein (7 nm diameter).
* **Polarity:** Possess a plus end and a minus end.
* **Functional Arrays:**
    * **Microvilli:** Stiff, stable bundles (e.g., intestinal lining).
    * **Contractile Bundles:** Tiny muscle-like bundles (stress fibers).
    * **Dynamic Protrusions:** Lamellipodia/Filopodia at the leading edge.
    * **Contractile Ring:** Pinches cytoplasm during cell division.
* **ATP Hydrolysis:** Free actin monomers carry ATP. Hydrolysis to ADP promotes depolymerization.
* **Treadmilling:** Individual monomers move through the filament from the plus to the minus end. This occurs when the rate of addition (plus end) equals the rate of loss (minus end).

### 4.2 Actin-Binding Proteins
Actin behavior is controlled by various binding proteins:
* **Nucleating proteins:** (e.g., formin, ARP complex) promote polymerization.
* **Monomer-sequestering proteins:** Specifically **thymosin** and **profilin** bind to actin monomers in the cytosol, preventing them from adding to filaments.
* **Side-binding proteins:** (e.g., **Tropomyosin**) bind to the side of actin filaments.
* **Cross-linking proteins:** Organize filaments.
    * *Parallel bundles:* Microvilli.
    * *Gel-like meshwork:* Cell cortex (provides mechanical strength).
* **Severing proteins:** Fragment filaments to convert an actin gel to a fluid state.
* **Motor proteins:** (Myosin) associate for contraction.

### 4.3 Drugs Affecting Actin
* **Phalloidin:** Binds and stabilizes filaments.
* **Cytochalasin:** Caps filament plus ends, preventing polymerization.
* **Latrunculin:** Binds actin monomers, preventing polymerization.

## 5. Cell Migration

### 5.1 Mechanism of Crawling
Cell crawling involves three coordinated steps:
1.  **Protrusion:** The cell pushes out protrusions (lamellipodia or filopodia) at the leading edge via actin polymerization.
    * *Lamellipodia:* Dense meshwork of actin.
    * *ARP Complex:* Nucleates new filaments, forming a branched web that pushes the membrane forward.
2.  **Attachment:** Protrusions adhere to the surface via **focal contacts** (containing integrins).
3.  **Traction:** The rest of the cell drags itself forward using anchorage points.

### 5.2 Regulation by Rho GTPases
Activation of Rho-family GTPases organizes actin filaments:
* **Rho activation:** Promotes contractile bundles (stress fibers).
* **Rac activation:** Promotes lamellipodia formation.
* **Cdc42 activation:** Promotes filopodia formation.

## 6. Muscle Contraction

### 6.1 Myosin Types
* **Myosin-I:** Simplest form. Single head and tail. Head binds actin; tail binds cargo (vesicles). Moves toward actin plus end.
* **Myosin-II:** Found in muscle. Dimer with two globular heads and a coiled-coil tail.
    * **Filament Formation:** Tails associate to form bipolar filaments with heads projecting outward in opposite directions. A central **bare region** contains only tails.

### 6.2 The Sarcomere
* **Hierarchy:** Muscle Cell (Fiber) $\rightarrow$ Myofibrils $\rightarrow$ Sarcomeres. Muscle fibers are large, multinucleated cells.
* **Definition:** The contractile unit of muscle, roughly 2.5 $\mu$m long.
* **Components:**
    * **Z discs:** Attachment points for actin (thin) filaments.
    * **Thin filaments:** Actin.
    * **Thick filaments:** Myosin-II, located centrally.
* **Sliding Filament Mechanism:** Muscle contraction is caused by simultaneous shortening of sarcomeres. Actin filaments slide past myosin filaments; the filaments themselves do not change length.

### 6.3 The Contraction Cycle
The myosin head walks along actin via an ATP-dependent cycle:
1.  **Attached (Rigor):** Myosin head bound tightly to actin (no ATP).
2.  **Released:** ATP binds to myosin; head releases actin.
3.  **Cocked:** ATP hydrolysis occurs. The head changes shape and is displaced 5 nm along the filament.
4.  **Force-Generating:** The release of inorganic phosphate (produced by hydrolysis) triggers the **power stroke**, restoring the head to its original shape and losing ADP.
5.  **Attached:** Head is bound tightly again in a new position.

### 6.4 Regulation of Contraction
* **Channel Interaction:** The voltage-gated $Ca^{2+}$ channel in the T-tubule membrane activates the $Ca^{2+}$-release channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane to release calcium.
* **Mechanism:**
    * **Resting State:** **Tropomyosin** blocks the myosin-binding site on actin.
    * **Contraction:** Ca2+ binds to the **troponin complex**, causing a shape change that moves tropomyosin, exposing the binding site and allowing myosin to bind.
