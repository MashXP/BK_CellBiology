# Cell Metabolism and Energy (ATP Production) Study Guide

## 1. How Cells Obtain Energy from Food

### 1.1 Fundamental Principles
*   **Purpose:** Cellular energy is used for growth, division, and other cellular activities.
*   **Source:** Energy is derived from chemical bonds in food molecules through **cell metabolism**.
*   **Food Components:** Sugars, fats, proteins, and other organic molecules.
*   **Conservation of Energy Production:** The process of breaking down sugars for energy is highly conserved across animals and plants.
*   **Cell Respiration:** Sugar molecules are broken down and oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O).
*   **Energy Capture:** Reactions capture energy in "high-energy" chemical bonds (covalent bonds that release large amounts of energy when hydrolyzed) in **activated carriers** such as ATP and NADH.

### 1.2 Controlled, Stepwise Oxidation of Sugar
*   **Direct Burning (Nonliving System):** Releases all free energy as heat in one step (high activation energy). Glucose + O2 → Heat + CO2 + H2O.
*   **Stepwise Oxidation (In Cells):**
    *   Enzymes catalyze the breakdown of sugars through a series of small steps.
    *   Each step involves small activation energies overcome by enzymes at body temperature.
    *   Portion of free energy is captured in activated carriers (ATP, NADH).
    *   The oxidation of food molecules provides energy for the immediate production of ATP (ADP + Pi → ATP) and other activated carriers. These then drive ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation.
*   **Efficiency:** Nearly 50% of the theoretical energy from glucose breakdown can be captured as ATP, compared to ~20% for useful work in modern combustion engines (the rest is lost as heat).

## 2. Mitochondria: The Powerhouses of the Cell

### 2.1 Structure of a Mitochondrion
*   **Double Membrane:**
    *   **Outer Membrane:** Permeable to molecules ≤ 5000 daltons due to large channel-forming proteins (porins).
    *   **Inner Membrane:** Folded into numerous **cristae**. Contains proteins for oxidative phosphorylation (electron-transport chain, ATP synthase) and transport proteins for selective molecule movement.
*   **Internal Spaces:**
    *   **Matrix:** Large internal space containing a highly concentrated mixture of hundreds of enzymes for oxidation of pyruvate, fatty acids, and the citric acid cycle.
    *   **Intermembrane Space:** Contains enzymes that use ATP from the matrix to phosphorylate other nucleotides. Also contains proteins released during apoptosis.

### 2.2 Mitochondrial Features
*   **Morphology:** Can divide like bacteria (e.g., in *S. cerevisiae*), supporting the endosymbiotic theory.
*   **Location:** Located near sites of high ATP utilization (e.g., between myofibrils in cardiac muscle, in sperm tails).
*   **Dynamic Networks:** Often form elongated, tubular networks that extend throughout the cytoplasm.
*   **Shared Ancestry:** Mitochondria and chloroplasts share features with their bacterial ancestors (e.g., DNA, ribosomes, double membranes).

## 3. Stages of Food Molecule Breakdown in Animals (Catabolism)

### 3.1 Stage 1: Breakdown of Large Food Molecules
*   **Process:** Large food molecules (proteins, polysaccharides, fats) are broken down into simpler subunits (amino acids, simple sugars, fatty acids, and glycerol).
*   **Location:** Occurs in the intestine (outside the cell) or in lysosomes (inside the cell).

### 3.2 Stage 2: Breakdown of Simple Subunits to Acetyl CoA
*   **Process:** Simple subunits (e.g., glucose, amino acids, fatty acids) are broken down further to **acetyl CoA**.
*   **Glycolysis:** Glucose → 2 pyruvate (in cytosol). Pyruvate then enters mitochondria.
*   **ATP & NADH Production:** Limited amounts of ATP and NADH are produced in this stage.
*   **Amino Acid Metabolism:** Some amino acids are transported into the mitochondrial matrix and converted to acetyl CoA or citric acid cycle intermediates.

### 3.3 Stage 3: Complete Oxidation to CO2 and H2O
*   **Process:** Acetyl groups in acetyl CoA are completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O.
*   **Citric Acid Cycle:** Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, oxidizing acetyl CoA to CO2.
*   **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** Occurs on the inner mitochondrial membrane, generating large amounts of ATP.

## 4. Glycolysis: Extracting Energy from Sugar

### 4.1 Overview
*   **Definition:** "Sugar splitting," a central metabolic pathway.
*   **Location:** Cytosol of most cells.
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** Does not require molecular oxygen (anaerobic).
*   **Evolutionary Significance:** Likely evolved early, before oxygen was prevalent in Earth's atmosphere.
*   **Product:** Glucose → 2 Pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH (Net Result).

### 4.2 The 10 Steps of Glycolysis
Glycolysis is divided into two main phases: energy investment and energy generation.

#### Energy Investment Phase (Steps 1-5):
*   **Step 1:** Glucose is phosphorylated by ATP (hexokinase) to Glucose 6-phosphate. The phosphate's negative charge traps glucose inside the cell.
*   **Step 2:** Glucose 6-phosphate is isomerized (phosphoglucose isomerase) to Fructose 6-phosphate.
*   **Step 3:** Fructose 6-phosphate is phosphorylated by ATP (phosphofructokinase) to Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This is a key control point.
*   **Step 4:** Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is cleaved (aldolase) into two three-carbon sugars: dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
*   **Step 5:** Dihydroxyacetone phosphate is isomerized (triose phosphate isomerase) to a second molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

#### Energy Generation Phase (Steps 6-10):
*   **Step 6:** Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is oxidized, and NAD+ is reduced to NADH + H+ (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Inorganic phosphate is added, forming 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (high-energy anhydride bond). This reaction is coupled to NADH formation and a high-energy thioester bond.
*   **Step 7:** A high-energy phosphate from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate is transferred to ADP, forming ATP (phosphoglycerate kinase). This is a substrate-level phosphorylation. Product: 3-phosphoglycerate.
*   **Step 8:** The phosphate group on 3-phosphoglycerate is moved (phosphoglycerate mutase) to carbon 2, forming 2-phosphoglycerate.
*   **Step 9:** Water is removed from 2-phosphoglycerate (enolase), forming phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which has a very high-energy phosphate bond.
*   **Step 10:** The high-energy phosphate from PEP is transferred to ADP, forming ATP (pyruvate kinase). This is another substrate-level phosphorylation. Product: Pyruvate.

### 4.2.1 Key Enzymes in Glycolysis

Glycolysis involves several classes of enzymes, each playing a crucial role in the breakdown of glucose:

*   **Kinase:** These enzymes catalyze the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate, or from a phosphorylated substrate to ADP. In glycolysis, hexokinase (Step 1) and phosphofructokinase (Step 3) add phosphate groups, while phosphoglycerate kinase (Step 7) and pyruvate kinase (Step 10) transfer phosphate groups to ADP to form ATP (substrate-level phosphorylation).
*   **Isomerase:** These enzymes catalyze the conversion of one isomer to another. Phosphoglucose isomerase (Step 2) converts glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate, and triose phosphate isomerase (Step 5) interconverts dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
*   **Dehydrogenase:** These enzymes catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, often involving the transfer of hydride ions (H-) to coenzymes like NAD+. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Step 6) oxidizes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and reduces NAD+ to NADH.
*   **Mutase:** These enzymes catalyze the intramolecular transfer of a functional group. Phosphoglycerate mutase (Step 8) moves the phosphate group from the 3-position to the 2-position on phosphoglycerate.

### 4.3 Fermentation (Absence of Oxygen)
*   **Purpose:** Breaks down sugar to produce ATP in anaerobic conditions.
*   **Mechanism:** Restores NAD+ from NADH, which is crucial for glycolysis to continue.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Muscle cells:** Pyruvate → Lactate (Lactate dehydrogenase).
    *   **Yeast:** Pyruvate → Ethanol + CO2.
*   **Efficiency:** Much less energy yield than aerobic respiration.
*   **Anaerobic Respiration:** Differs from fermentation by using an electron-transport chain with a molecule other than oxygen as the final electron acceptor.

## 5. The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle/Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle)

### 5.1 Overview
*   **Location:** Mitochondrial matrix.
*   **Purpose:** Catalyzes the complete oxidation of acetyl groups (from acetyl CoA) to CO2.
*   **Oxygen Requirement:** None of its steps directly use molecular oxygen.
*   **Water Usage:** Three molecules of H2O are split per turn, and their oxygen atoms are ultimately used to make CO2.
*   **Net Result per Turn (from one acetyl group):** 3 NADH, 1 GTP, 1 FADH2, and 2 CO2.

### 5.2 Key Steps
1.  **Acetyl CoA + Oxaloacetate → Citrate:** (Citrate synthase) Acetyl CoA (2C) enters the cycle by combining with oxaloacetate (4C) to form citrate (6C).
2.  **Citrate → Isocitrate:** (Aconitase) Isomerization.
3.  **Isocitrate → α-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH:** (Isocitrate dehydrogenase) First oxidative decarboxylation, producing CO2 and NADH.
4.  **α-Ketoglutarate → Succinyl CoA + CO2 + NADH:** (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex) Second oxidative decarboxylation, producing CO2, NADH, and a high-energy thioester bond in succinyl CoA.
5.  **Succinyl CoA → Succinate + GTP (+ HS-CoA):** (Succinyl CoA synthetase) Inorganic phosphate displaces CoA, forming a high-energy phosphate bond that is passed to GDP to form GTP (substrate-level phosphorylation). ATP is formed instead of GTP in bacteria and plants.
6.  **Succinate → Fumarate + FADH2:** (Succinate dehydrogenase) Oxidation, producing FADH2.
7.  **Fumarate → Malate:** (Fumarase) Addition of water.
8.  **Malate → Oxaloacetate + NADH:** (Malate dehydrogenase) Oxidation, regenerating oxaloacetate and producing NADH.

## 6. Metabolic Connections and Regulation

### 6.1 Glycolysis & Citric Acid Cycle as Precursor Sources
*   **Anabolic Pathways:** Intermediates from these cycles are converted into amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and other small organic molecules needed by the cell.
*   **Examples:** Oxaloacetate and α-ketoglutarate can be transferred from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol to form amino acids (aspartate, glutamate).

### 6.2 Control of Enzyme Activities
Enzyme activities are coordinated by:
1.  **Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation:** Addition or removal of phosphate groups.
2.  **Allosteric Regulation:** Binding of small regulatory molecules (metabolites).

### 6.3 Feedback Regulation (Glucose Synthesis vs. Breakdown)
*   **Gluconeogenesis:** Synthesis of glucose from pyruvate (e.g., when glucose is scarce).
*   **Regulation Example:** Phosphofructokinase (glycolysis) and Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (gluconeogenesis) are reciprocally regulated by ATP/ADP levels to switch between glucose breakdown and synthesis.

### 6.4 Energy Storage
*   **Animals:** Store glucose as **glycogen** (in liver and muscle) and fats as **lipid droplets**.
*   **Plants:** Store glucose as **starch granules** and fats in **lipid droplets** (in chloroplasts). Plant seeds serve as important food sources for humans.

## 7. Oxidative Phosphorylation

### 7.1 Overview
*   **Purpose:** Completes the catabolism of food molecules and generates the bulk of ATP.
*   **Mechanism:** Membrane-based mechanisms use energy from food (or sunlight in photosynthesis) to generate ATP.
*   **Core Process:** Electron transfer pumps protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthase to produce ATP.

### 7.2 The Electron-Transport Chain
*   **Location:** Inner mitochondrial membrane.
*   **Function:** Transfers high-energy electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen.
*   **Proton Pumping:** As electrons move along the chain, protons are pumped from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space.
*   **Components:** Three main respiratory enzyme complexes:
    1.  **NADH dehydrogenase complex:** Accepts electrons from NADH.
    2.  **Cytochrome c reductase complex:**
    3.  **Cytochrome c oxidase complex:** Transfers electrons to O2 to form H2O.
*   **Electron Carriers:**
    *   **Ubiquinone (Q):** Small, lipid-soluble carrier that transports electrons within the lipid bilayer.
    *   **Cytochrome c:** Mobile electron carrier.
    *   **Heme Groups:** Iron in heme can serve as an electron acceptor.
*   **Redox Potential:** Increases along the chain, driving electron flow. Each transfer involves the movement of hydrogen atoms (protons and electrons).
*   **Proton Pumping Mechanism:** The orientation of membrane-embedded electron carriers allows electron transfer to drive proton pumping. Proton pumping is coupled to electron transport.

### 7.3 ATP Synthase
*   **Function:** Acts as a motor to convert the energy of protons flowing down their electrochemical gradient into chemical-bond energy in ATP (P + ADP → ATP).
*   **Structure:** Consists of a rotor (F0) embedded in the membrane and a stationary head (F1 ATPase) in the matrix.
*   **Reversibility:** ATP synthase is a reversible coupling device; it can synthesize ATP using a proton gradient or pump protons using ATP hydrolysis.

### 7.4 Electrochemical Proton Gradient
*   **Components:**
    *   **Membrane Potential (ΔV):** Large force due to charge difference across the membrane.
    *   **pH Gradient (ΔpH):** Smaller force due to proton concentration difference.
*   **Proton-Motive Force:** The sum of ΔV and ΔpH, driving protons back into the matrix.
*   **Coupled Transport:** The proton gradient is used to drive other transport processes, e.g., pyruvate import, phosphate import, and ADP-ATP exchange.

### 7.5 Uncoupling Agents
*   **Mechanism:** H+ carriers that insert into the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing protons to bypass ATP synthase.
*   **Effect:** Dissipates the proton gradient, generating heat instead of ATP.

## 8. Photosynthesis: Energy from Sunlight

### 8.1 Overview
*   **Purpose:** Converts light energy into chemical energy (ATP, NADPH) to fix carbon.
*   **Location:** Chloroplasts (in plant and algal cells).
*   **Two Stages:**
    1.  **Light Reactions (Stage 1):** In thylakoid membrane. Photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions produce ATP and NADPH. Water is split, releasing O2.
    2.  **Light-Independent Reactions (Stage 2 / Carbon-Fixation Cycle):** In stroma. Uses ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 into sugar, amino acids, and fatty acids.

### 8.2 Chloroplast Structure
*   **Double Membrane:** Inner and outer membranes.
*   **Stroma:** Large internal space containing enzymes for carbon fixation.
*   **Thylakoid Membrane:** Internal membrane system, folded into flattened sacs (thylakoids) often stacked into **grana**. Contains chlorophyll and electron-transfer chains.
*   **Energy Storage:** Often contain large stores of carbohydrates (starch granules) and fatty acids (lipid droplets).

### 8.3 Light Reactions
*   **Chlorophylls:** Pigments that absorb blue and red wavelengths of light (poorly absorbs green).
*   **Photosystem:** Consists of a reaction center surrounded by chlorophyll-containing antenna complexes.
    *   **Antenna Complexes:** Harvest light energy and transfer it to the reaction center.
    *   **Reaction Center:** Chlorophyll "special pair" absorbs light, and a high-energy electron is transferred to a mobile carrier, becoming part of an electron-transport chain.
*   **Photosystem II:**
    *   **Water-Splitting Enzyme:** Catalyzes extraction of electrons from water (2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e-). This replenishes electrons to the special pair.
    *   **Proton Pumping:** Feeds electrons to a photosynthetic proton pump (cytochrome b6-f complex), leading to ATP production by ATP synthase.
*   **Photosystem I:**
    *   **NADPH Production:** Transfers high-energy electrons to an enzyme (ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, FNR) that produces NADPH (H+ + NADP+ → NADPH).
*   **Combined Action:** Photosystems I and II work in series to boost electrons to the energy level needed to produce both ATP and NADPH.

### 8.4 Carbon-Fixation Cycle (Calvin Cycle)
*   **Location:** Chloroplast stroma.
*   **Enzyme:** **Rubisco** (Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase) catalyzes carbon fixation.
    *   Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (5C) + CO2 (1C) → Intermediate → 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3C each).
*   **Energy Consumption:** Consumes ATP and NADPH to convert 3-phosphoglycerate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.
*   **Net Result:** For every 3 molecules of CO2 that enter, 1 molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (a 3C sugar) is produced. This costs 9 ATP and 6 NADPH.
*   **Sugar Formation:** Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can be used to synthesize sugars, fats, and amino acids.

## 9. Evolution of Metabolism

### 9.2 Chemiosmotic Processes
*   **Evolution in Stages:** Likely evolved gradually.
    1.  **Stage 1:** Primitive cells with ATP-driven proton pumps (hydrolyze ATP to pump protons).
    2.  **Stage 2:** Evolution of electron-transport proteins that pump protons (using electron energy).
    3.  **Stage 3:** ATP-driven proton pump evolved to work in reverse (ATP synthase), using the proton gradient to make ATP.
*   **Hydrogen Sulfide Photosynthesis:** Green sulfur bacteria use H2S as an electron donor (instead of H2O), producing S instead of O2.
