# **Chapter 2: Cell Observation**

## **2.1 Cell Separation and Disaggregation**

### **Purpose of Cell Separation**
Isolating specific cell populations from heterogeneous samples to:
- Minimize interference in experiments.
- Obtain a large number of a specific cell type for research.
- Applications: Capturing circulating tumor cells, isolating immune cells, and drug testing on specific cell types.

### **Tissue Disaggregation Methods**
- **Mechanical Methods:** Physical disruption using tools like mortars, pestles, or sieves. Typically results in low cell yields.
- **Enzymatic Methods:** Using enzymes to break down the extracellular matrix. This is a milder method that yields a higher number of viable cells.
    - **Animal Tissue Enzymes:** Collagenase, trypsin (break down collagen, elastin, etc.).
    - **Plant Tissue Enzymes:** Pectinase, cellulase, lignase (break down cellulose, hemicellulose, etc.).

## **2.2 Cell Sorting Methods**

- **Filtration:** Separates cells based on size.
- **Density Gradient Centrifugation:** Separates cells or organelles based on their density by spinning them in a centrifuge.
- **Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting (MACS):** Uses magnetic beads coated with antibodies to bind to specific cell surface markers, allowing for magnetic separation.
- **Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS):** Cells are labeled with fluorescent markers and then sorted based on their fluorescence.

## **2.3 Cell Preservation and Staining**

### **Cell Fixation**
- **Purpose:** To preserve cells and their components in a life-like state, prevent autolysis (self-digestion), and prepare them for staining.
- **Mechanism:** Creates covalent bonds between proteins, cross-linking them and holding them in place.

### **Cell Staining**
- **Purpose:** To enhance contrast and reveal cellular structures under a microscope.
- **Types of Dyes:**
    - **Protein-binding dyes**
    - **DNA binding dyes**
    - **Congo Red:** Stains β-amyloid plaques.
    - **Fluorescent dyes:** Absorb and emit light (e.g., fluorescein for cell membranes).

## **2.4 Microscopy**

### **Fundamental Principles**
- **Magnification:** The degree to which an object is enlarged.
- **Resolution:** The ability to distinguish between two closely spaced objects.

### **Types of Microscopes**
- **Light Microscopes:**
    - **Stereo Microscope:** For low-magnification observation of surfaces.
    - **Compound Microscope:** High resolution, 2D images.
    - **Inverted Microscope:** For observing live cells in culture vessels.
    - **Fluorescence Microscope:** Uses fluorescence to generate an image. Studying the structural properties of organic or inorganic samples (primarily biological samples).
    - **Dark-field Microscope:** Increases contrast in unstained samples by illuminating them from the side.
    - **Phase-contrast Microscope:** Enhances contrast in transparent samples by altering the phase of light. Used to observe living cells.
- **Electron Microscopes:**
    - **Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM):** Provides high-resolution images of the internal structure of cells.
    - **Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM):** Creates detailed images of the surface of cells and organisms.
