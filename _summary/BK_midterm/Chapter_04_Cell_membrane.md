# **Chapter 4: Cell Membrane**

## **4.1 Membrane Structure**

### **Fluid Mosaic Model**
* Proposed by Singer and Nicholson (1972).
* The membrane is a fluid structure composed of a **phospholipid bilayer** with a "mosaic" of various proteins embedded or attached.
* Other components include **glycolipids**, **glycoproteins**, and **cholesterol**.

### **Membrane Lipids**
The membrane lipids are classified into three main types:
* **Phospholipids:** These are the main component of the membrane. They have:
    * **Hydrophilic Heads:** Attracted to water.
    * **Hydrophobic Tails:** Repel water.
* **Sphingolipids:** A type of phospholipid important in signal transduction and cell recognition.
* **Sterols (e.g., Cholesterol):** Found in animal cell membranes, cholesterol helps maintain membrane fluidity and is involved in signaling.


## **4.2 Membrane Characteristics**

### **Membrane Fluidity**
This describes the ease of movement of molecules within the membrane.
* Lipids and proteins are loosely attached, allowing them to move.
* **Unsaturated fatty acids** have double bonds that create space, maintaining fluidity.
* **Cholesterol** in animal cells acts as a buffer, preventing the membrane from becoming too fluid at high temperatures or too rigid at low temperatures.
* Phospholipids can exhibit several types of movement: **rotation**, **flexion**, **lateral movement**, and **flip-flop**.

### **Membrane Asymmetry**
The membrane lacks uniformity, meaning the inner and outer layers have different molecular compositions.
* The **outer membrane** combines with glycoproteins and glycolipids.
* The **inner membrane** combines with microfilaments.

### **Selective Permeability**
This is the ability to control which substances pass in and out of the cell. This is essential for maintaining the cell's internal environment, such as its **osmotic pressure**, **pH**, and **ion concentration**.


## **4.3 Membrane Functions**

### **General Cell Membrane Functions**
* Protects the cell.
* Transports nutrients into the cell and secretes toxic substances out.
* Interacts with other cells.
* Provides structural support.
* Maintains stable osmotic pressure.
* Involved in signal transduction.

### **Membrane Protein Functions**
* **Receptor Proteins:** Relay signals between the cell's internal and external environments.
* **Transport Proteins:** Transfer molecules and ions across the membrane.
* **Membrane Enzymes:** Catalyze chemical reactions.
* **Cell Adhesion Proteins:** Enable cells to recognize and interact with one another.


## **4.4 Transport Across the Cell Membrane**

### **Passive Transport**
This process **does not require energy** and involves substances moving down their concentration gradient.

* **Simple Diffusion:** The direct movement of molecules (like $O_{2}$, $CO_{2}$, NO, and steroid hormones) from higher to lower concentration across the membrane.
* **Osmosis:** The movement of a solvent (like water) across a semipermeable membrane. Water can pass through the lipid bilayer or through specific protein channels called **aquaporins**.
    * **Hypertonic:** Solution has a higher solute concentration; cell shrinks.
    * **Isotonic:** Solution has the same concentration; no net change.
    * **Hypotonic:** Solution has a lower solute concentration; cell swells.
* **Facilitated Diffusion:** A type of passive transport that uses specialized proteins (like **channels** and **carriers**) to help substances cross the membrane.

### **Active Transport**
This process **requires energy** (often from ATP) to move molecules or ions across a membrane **against their concentration gradient** (from low to high).

* **Factors Affecting:** Active transport is influenced by temperature, pH, enzyme inhibitors, and the availability of oxygen, glucose, and ATP.
* **Protein Pumps:** Involves specialized carrier proteins. A key example is the **Na+/K+ pump**.
* **Transporter Types:**
    * **Uniporter:** Moves one substance.
    * **Symporter:** Moves two different substances in the same direction.
    * **Antiporter:** Moves two different substances in opposite directions.
* **Cotransport:** A form of secondary active transport. It uses the energy from one substance (like H+) diffusing down its gradient (which was established by a primary pump using ATP) to move a second substance (like sucrose) against its gradient.

### **Vesicular Transport**
This is a form of active transport used for large molecules.

* **Endocytosis:** A process where substances are brought *into* the cell by the membrane folding in to form a vesicle.
* **Exocytosis:** A process where substances (like waste or hormones) are *secreted out* of the cell by the fusion of a vesicle with the plasma membrane. This is also a form of active transport.
