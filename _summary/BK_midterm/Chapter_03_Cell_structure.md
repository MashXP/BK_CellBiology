# **Chapter 3: Cell Structure**

## **3.1 Cell Composition and Size**

### **Composition**
* **Water:** >70%
* **Inorganic ions**
* **Organic molecules:** Over 10,000 different kinds.

### **Size**
* **Bacteria:** $0.2~\mu m$ in diameter and $2-8~\mu m$ in length
* **Yeast:** $3-4~\mu m$ (up to $40~\mu m$)
* **Animal and Plant Cells:** $10-100~\mu m$
* **Largest cells:** Eggs
* **Longest cells:** Muscle cells and neurons

## **3.2 Prokaryotic Structure**

* **Size:** Much smaller than eukaryotes.
* **Organization:** Simple, unicellular organism.
* **Common Shapes:** Helices, spheres, and rods.
* **Nucleus:** Lack an organized nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. The single, circular DNA is in the **nucleoid** region.
* **Plasmids:** Some possess small, circular, double-stranded DNA. These can self-replicate and be transmitted, often providing survival advantages like antibiotic resistance.
* **Cytoplasm:** The cell is filled with cytoplasm, which contains ribosomes for protein synthesis and enzymes for metabolism.
* **Cell Wall:** Most have a cell wall made of **peptidoglycan** that provides physical protection and maintains osmotic pressure.
* **Capsule:** A sticky outer layer (polysaccharide/protein) that helps the cell stick to surfaces and provides additional protection.
* **Cytoskeleton:** Small protein filaments under the plasma membrane that help define the division plane, control cell width, and are required for cell curvature.

### **Flagella and Pili**
* **Presence:** Some bacteria have flagella, pili, and capsules.
* **Arrangement:** Flagella can be arranged in several ways:
    * **Monotrichous** (single flagellum)
    * **Lophotrichous** (a tuft of flagella at one end)
    * **Amphitrichous** (flagella at both ends)
    * **Peritrichous** (flagella all over the surface)
* **Movement:** Flagella are used for movement, which consists of two main actions:
    * **Forward run:** The flagella rotate to propel the cell forward.
    * **Tumble:** The flagella reverse rotation, causing the cell to randomly change direction.

## **3.3 Eukaryotic Structure**

### **Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and Cell Junctions**
* **Plant ECM (Cell Wall):** Made of cellulose and other materials. It provides **protection**, gives a **definite shape** to the cell, and plays a role in cell differentiation.
* **Animal ECM:** Made of protein and carbohydrates. Its functions include **protecting cells**, modulating access to receptors, and managing **cell-cell** and **cell-substrate** interactions.
* **Glycocalyx:** A negatively charged sugar-protein barrier that coats blood vascular endothelium, protecting it from mechanical and oxidative stress.
* **Cell Junctions:** Essential for organizing tissues. Types include:
    * **Tight Junctions**
    * **Anchoring Junctions**
    * **Gap Junctions**
* **Plasmodesmata (Plants):** Channels between adjacent plant cells that allow ions, amino acids, and sugars to diffuse freely.

### **Cytoplasm and Organelles**
* **Cytosol:** The semi-fluid matrix, about 70% water, that contains ions, macromolecules, and enzymes. Its functions include embedding organelles, **signal transduction**, transporting metabolites, and **cytokinesis**.
* **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER):** A complex network of tubules and sacs that may represent 10% of total cell volume.
    * **Rough ER (RER):** Synthesizes polypeptides, ensures **quality control** of protein folding, and handles **protein sorting**.
    * **Smooth ER (SER):** Synthesizes **phospholipids and cholesterol**, produces steroid hormones, plays roles in carbohydrate metabolism, and **stores and releases calcium ions**.
* **Golgi Apparatus:** A "factory" where proteins from the ER are further processed and sorted. It also synthesizes some lipids and the **polysaccharides** for the plant cell wall.
* **Lysosomes (Animal cells):** Single-membrane organelles containing over 60 different **digestive enzymes**. They break down unnecessary components, destroy invading viruses/bacteria, and can help the cell **self-destruct** if damaged.
* **Vacuoles:** Membrane-bound organelles with no basic shape or size. Functions include storing materials, holding pigments, **digestion** (in plants/yeast), containing waste, and **regulating osmotic pressure**.
* **Ribosomes:** **None membrane-bound** organelles, 25-30 nm in diameter. They consist of two subunits (60S and 40S) and are found in the cytosol, mitochondria, and chloroplasts. Their function is **polypeptide synthesis**.
* **Mitochondria:** Membrane-bound organelles, typically 0.5 to 10 µm in size. They are the "powerhouses" that produce large quantities of energy as **ATP**.
* **Plastids (Plant cells):** Vary in shape, size, and color. They contain pigments and reserve substances.
    * **Chloroplasts:** The sites of **photosynthesis**. Their photosynthetic pigments are located in the **thylakoids**.
* **Cytoskeleton (Eukaryotic):** A network of protein filaments.
    * **Microfilaments** (~6 nm)
    * **Intermediate filaments** (~10 nm)
    * **Microtubules** (~25 nm)
* **Nucleus:** A **double membrane-enclosed** organelle that contains the cell's chromosomes. **Nuclear pores** provide channels for transporting large molecules.
* **Peroxisomes:** Membrane-bound organelles that play a key role in the **oxidation** of biomolecules, biosynthesis of membrane lipids, and **photorespiration** in plants.
* **Proteasome:** A cylindrical complex of proteins found in the nucleus and protoplasm of eukaryotes (and some bacteria). Its main function is **degrading misfolded proteins**.
