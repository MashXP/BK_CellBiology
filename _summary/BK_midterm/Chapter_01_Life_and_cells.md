# **Chapter 1: Life and Cells**

## **1.1 The Concept of Life**

Life is the quality that distinguishes matter with biological processes (such as signaling and self-sustaining processes) from matter that does not.

## **1.2 Cell Theory and Classification**

### **Cell Theory**
The modern tenets of the Cell Theory state that:
- All known living things are composed of one or more cells.
- All living cells arise from pre-existing cells by division.
- The cell is the fundamental unit of structure and function in all living organisms.

### **Classification of Organisms**
- **Unicellular:** Organisms consisting of a single cell (e.g., Yeast, Bacteria, Protozoa Paramecium, Green algae).
- **Multicellular:** Organisms consisting of multiple cells.

### **Classification of Cells**
- **Prokaryotic cells:** Lack a true nucleus and membrane-bound organelles.
- **Eukaryotic cells:** Contain a membrane-bound nucleus and organelles.
- **Somatic cells:** Diploid cells forming the body of an organism.
- **Germ cells:** Divide to produce haploid gametes (eggs and sperm).

## **1.3 Key Characteristics of Living Organisms**

- **Cellular Organization:** Made up of one or more cells.
- **Sensitivity:** Respond to the environment.
- **Reproduction:** Capable of producing offspring.
- **Growth and Development:** Increase in size and complexity.
- **Regulation:** Maintain a stable internal environment (homeostasis).
- **Energy Processing:** Acquire and use energy.

## **1.4 The Origin and Evolution of Cells**

### **Steps to the First Cell**
1.  **Formation of Organic Molecules:** Simple organic molecules formed from inorganic components, as proposed by Oparin and tested in the Miller-Urey experiment.
2.  **Formation of Macromolecules:** Monomers polymerize to form macromolecules (e.g., polypeptides from amino acids).
3.  **Self-Replication:** A molecule, likely RNA, gained the ability to self-replicate.
4.  **Formation of Cell Membranes:** Phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers in water, creating enclosed compartments.
5.  **The First Cell:** A self-replicating RNA molecule became enclosed within a phospholipid membrane.

### **Evolutionary Developments**
- **Division of Labor:** DNA took over the role of heredity, and proteins took over catalysis, with RNA mediating between them.
- **From Prokaryote to Eukaryote:**
    - **Infolding of Cell Membranes:** The nuclear envelope and endoplasmic reticulum may have originated from infoldings of the plasma membrane.
    - **Endosymbiotic Theory:** Mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have originated from the engulfment of prokaryotic cells by a larger host cell.

## **1.5 Cellular Metabolism**

- **Catabolism:** Metabolic pathways that break down molecules into smaller units, releasing energy.
- **Anabolism:** Metabolic pathways that construct molecules from smaller units, requiring energy.

## **1.6 Specialized Infectious Agents**

- **Viruses:** Non-living particles consisting of genetic material (DNA or RNA) enclosed in a protein capsid. They require a host cell to replicate.
- **Viroids:** Small, circular, single-stranded RNA molecules that infect plants. They do not code for proteins.
- **Prions:** Misfolded proteins (PrPSc) that can induce the misfolding of normal proteins (PrPc), leading to neurodegenerative diseases.
