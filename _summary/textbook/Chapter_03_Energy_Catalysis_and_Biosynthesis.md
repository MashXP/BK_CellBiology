# **Summary: Chapter 3 - Energy, Catalysis, and Biosynthesis**

## **I. The Use of Energy by Cells**
*   **Biological Order and Thermodynamics:** Living cells create and maintain a high degree of order, which seems to defy the second law of thermodynamics (the universal tendency toward disorder/entropy). They achieve this by taking in energy from their environment and releasing heat, thereby increasing the total entropy of the universe (cell + environment).
*   **Metabolism:** The sum of all chemical reactions in a cell, divided into two streams:
    *   **Catabolism:** The breakdown of food molecules into smaller molecules (e.g., cell respiration). These are oxidative, energetically favorable reactions that release energy.
    *   **Anabolism (Biosynthesis):** The synthesis of complex organic molecules from simpler ones. These are reductive, energetically unfavorable reactions that require an energy input.
*   **Energy Conversion:** Cells obey the first law of thermodynamics (energy cannot be created or destroyed) by converting energy from one form to another. Photosynthetic organisms convert light energy into chemical-bond energy, while other organisms obtain this energy by oxidizing the organic molecules made by photosynthesis.
*   **Oxidation and Reduction:** These reactions involve the transfer of electrons. **Oxidation** is the loss of electrons (or a decrease in C-H bonds), and **reduction** is the gain of electrons (or an increase in C-H bonds). They are central to energy transfer in cells.

## **II. Free Energy and Catalysis**
*   **Free Energy (G):** The energy in a system that can be used to do work or drive chemical reactions.
*   **Free-Energy Change (ΔG):** A measure of the disorder created in the universe by a reaction. Energetically favorable (spontaneous) reactions have a negative ΔG. Energetically unfavorable reactions have a positive ΔG and can only occur if coupled to a favorable reaction.
*   **Activation Energy:** Even energetically favorable reactions require an initial input of energy to overcome an energy barrier. This is the activation energy.
*   **Enzymes as Catalysts:** Enzymes are highly specific protein catalysts that greatly accelerate reaction rates by lowering the activation energy. They do *not* change the free energy (ΔG) or the equilibrium point of a reaction.
*   **Equilibrium:** A state where the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal (ΔG = 0). The ratio of products to substrates at equilibrium is the **equilibrium constant (K)**. Living cells are non-equilibrium systems that constantly exchange matter and energy with their environment to avoid reaching equilibrium.

## **III. Activated Carriers and Biosynthesis**
*   **Coupled Reactions:** Enzymes can couple an energetically favorable reaction (like ATP hydrolysis) to an unfavorable reaction to drive it forward. The net ΔG of the coupled reactions must be negative.
*   **Activated Carriers:** Small organic molecules that store energy in an easily exchangeable form (as a transferable chemical group or high-energy electrons). They link catabolism to anabolism.
*   **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** The most widely used activated carrier. It stores energy in its high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds. The cycle of ATP hydrolysis to ADP (energetically favorable) and ADP phosphorylation to ATP (energetically unfavorable) drives most cellular work.
*   **NADH and NADPH:** Activated carriers of high-energy electrons and protons (as a hydride ion, H⁻).
    *   **NADPH:** Primarily used in anabolic (biosynthetic) reactions as a reducing agent. The cell keeps the ratio of NADPH to NADP⁺ high.
    *   **NADH:** Primarily involved in catabolic reactions that generate ATP. The cell keeps the ratio of NADH to NAD⁺ low.
*   **Biosynthesis:** The synthesis of macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides) is an anabolic process. It occurs via condensation reactions that are energetically unfavorable and require energy input, typically derived from the hydrolysis of ATP and other activated carriers.
