# **Summary: Chapter 6 - DNA Replication and Repair**

## **I. The Mechanism of DNA Replication**
*   **Semiconservative Replication:** The process is "semiconservative" because each new DNA double helix consists of one old (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand. This was confirmed by the Meselson-Stahl experiment.
*   **Replication Origins and Forks:** DNA synthesis begins at specific sites called **replication origins**. Initiator proteins unwind the DNA, creating two Y-shaped **replication forks** that move away from the origin in opposite directions (bidirectional replication).
*   **DNA Polymerase:** This is the core enzyme of replication.
    *   **5'-to-3' Synthesis:** It synthesizes new DNA by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing strand, using the parental strand as a template.
    *   **Proofreading:** DNA polymerase is self-correcting. It has a 3'-to-5' exonuclease activity that removes mispaired nucleotides, ensuring a very low error rate (about 1 error in 10⁷ nucleotides).
*   **Asymmetry of the Replication Fork:**
    *   **Leading Strand:** One new strand is synthesized continuously in the 5'-to-3' direction as the fork moves.
    *   **Lagging Strand:** The other strand is synthesized discontinuously. As the fork exposes the template, short DNA fragments called **Okazaki fragments** are made in a "backstitching" manner (5'-to-3') and later joined together.
*   **Proteins of the Replication Machine:** Replication requires a coordinated group of proteins.
    *   **Primase:** An RNA polymerase that synthesizes short **RNA primers** to provide a 3' end for DNA polymerase to start synthesis.
    *   **DNA Helicase:** Sits at the front of the fork, using ATP hydrolysis to unwind the DNA double helix.
    *   **Single-Strand DNA-Binding Proteins:** Bind to unwound DNA to prevent it from re-forming a double helix.
    *   **Sliding Clamp:** A ring-shaped protein that keeps DNA polymerase firmly attached to the template strand.
    *   **DNA Ligase:** Joins the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand into a continuous strand using ATP.
    *   **DNA Topoisomerases:** Relieve the torsional stress and supercoiling that builds up ahead of the replication fork.
*   **Telomerase and End Replication:** In eukaryotes with linear chromosomes, the enzyme **telomerase** extends the ends of the chromosomes (telomeres) to prevent the lagging strand from shortening with each round of replication, thus solving the "end-replication problem."

## **II. The Mechanism of DNA Repair**
*   **Constant DNA Damage:** DNA is constantly damaged by spontaneous chemical reactions (e.g., depurination, deamination) and environmental factors (e.g., UV radiation causing thymine dimers).
*   **General Repair Pathway:** Most damage is repaired via a three-step "excision repair" mechanism that relies on the undamaged complementary strand as a template:
    1.  **Excision:** The damaged portion is recognized and removed by nucleases.
    2.  **Resynthesis:** A repair DNA polymerase fills the gap by synthesizing a new segment using the intact strand as a template.
    3.  **Ligation:** DNA ligase seals the nick in the sugar-phosphate backbone.
*   **Mismatch Repair:** This system corrects the rare replication errors that are missed by DNA polymerase's proofreading. It removes the mismatch from the *newly synthesized* strand, increasing the overall accuracy of replication to about 1 error in 10⁹ nucleotides.
*   **Repairing Double-Strand Breaks:**
    *   **Nonhomologous End Joining (NHEJ):** A "quick and dirty" mechanism that rapidly rejoins the broken ends. This process often results in the loss of a few nucleotides at the break site (an error-prone process).
    *   **Homologous Recombination (HR):** An accurate, error-free mechanism that uses an undamaged homologous DNA duplex (often a sister chromatid) as a template to flawlessly repair the break.
*   **Consequences of Repair Failure:** A failure to repair DNA damage results in **mutations**. The accumulation of mutations in somatic cells can lead to cancer, while mutations in germ-line cells cause inherited diseases like sickle-cell anemia. The high fidelity of replication and repair is essential for genetic stability.
