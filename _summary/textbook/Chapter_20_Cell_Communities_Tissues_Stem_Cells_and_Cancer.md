# **Summary: Chapter 20 - Cell Communities**

## **I. Extracellular Matrix and Connective Tissues**
*   **Plant Tissues and Cell Walls:** Plant cells are encased in a rigid **cell wall**, an extracellular matrix primarily composed of **cellulose microfibrils** (providing tensile strength) interwoven with other polysaccharides like pectin (resisting compression). The orientation of cellulose deposition, guided by underlying microtubules, directs the direction of cell elongation and thus plant growth.
*   **Animal Connective Tissues:** Characterized by an abundant **extracellular matrix (ECM)** that bears the mechanical load.
    *   **Collagens:** The major protein component, providing tensile strength. Fibroblasts secrete collagen precursors (**procollagen**), which are processed and self-assemble into fibrils and fibers outside the cell.
    *   **Proteoglycans and GAGs:** **Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)** are negatively charged polysaccharide chains that, along with **proteoglycans**, form a hydrated gel that fills spaces and resists compression.
    *   **Integrins and Fibronectin:** Cells attach to the ECM via **integrins**, transmembrane proteins that link the intracellular cytoskeleton (e.g., actin filaments) to ECM components like **fibronectin**, which in turn binds to collagen.

## **II. Epithelial Sheets and Cell Junctions**
*   **Epithelial Tissues:** Form multicellular sheets that line all body cavities and free surfaces. Cells are mechanically linked and bear the stress. Epithelial sheets are polarized, with an **apical** surface (facing the lumen or exterior) and a **basal** surface, which rests on the **basal lamina** (a specialized sheet of ECM).
*   **Cell Junctions:**
    *   **Tight Junctions:** Seal adjacent cells together, preventing the leakage of molecules between them and maintaining the distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains.
    *   **Adherens Junctions:** Connect actin filament bundles from cell to cell via **cadherin** proteins. They can form an "adhesion belt" that allows for coordinated contraction and folding of epithelial sheets.
    *   **Desmosomes:** Connect the intermediate filaments (keratins) of adjacent cells, also via cadherins. They provide great tensile strength to the tissue.
    *   **Hemidesmosomes:** Anchor the intermediate filaments of an epithelial cell to the basal lamina via **integrin** proteins.
    *   **Gap Junctions (Animals) and Plasmodesmata (Plants):** Create direct channels between the cytosols of adjacent cells, allowing for the passage of small molecules and ions, thus coupling the cells both electrically and metabolically.

## **III. Stem Cells and Tissue Renewal**
*   **Tissue Maintenance:** The stability of adult tissues depends on cell communication, selective cell adhesion, and cell memory. Many tissues undergo continuous turnover, with old cells being replaced by new ones.
*   **Stem Cells:** Undifferentiated cells that can divide indefinitely and have a choice to either remain a stem cell (self-renewal) or commit to a course of differentiation.
*   **Terminal Differentiation:** Most specialized cells that need replacement (e.g., gut epithelial cells, skin cells, blood cells) are **terminally differentiated** and cannot divide. They are replenished from a stock of proliferating precursor cells, which are produced by stem cells.
*   **Regulation:** Stem cell populations are maintained by specific signals in their local environment, or niche. For example, **Wnt signaling** maintains the stem cell and precursor cell population in the intestinal crypt.
*   **Pluripotent Stem Cells:**
    *   **Embryonic Stem (ES) Cells:** Derived from early embryos, they are **pluripotent**, meaning they can be induced to differentiate into any cell type in the body.
    *   **Induced Pluripotent Stem (iPS) Cells:** Differentiated adult cells that are reprogrammed back into an ES-like pluripotent state by the artificial expression of a few key transcription regulators.

## **IV. Cancer**
*   **Properties of Cancer:** Cancer is a disease of tissue renewal caused by the accumulation of somatic mutations. Cancer cells defy normal social controls, exhibiting two key properties:
    1.  **Uncontrolled Proliferation:** They divide in defiance of normal constraints.
    2.  **Invasion and Metastasis:** They invade territories reserved for other cells and can spread to distant sites (**metastasize**).
*   **Genetic Instability:** Cancer cells evolve through repeated rounds of mutation and natural selection. They are often **genetically unstable**, acquiring mutations at a higher rate due to defects in DNA replication, repair, or cell-cycle checkpoints.
*   **Key Genes:** Mutations in two main classes of genes are critical for cancer:
    1.  **Proto-oncogenes:** Normal genes involved in promoting cell survival or proliferation. A **gain-of-function** mutation (dominant) can convert a proto-oncogene into an **oncogene**, leading to hyperactivity (e.g., *Ras* mutations).
    2.  **Tumor Suppressor Genes:** Genes that normally inhibit cell proliferation or survival. A **loss-of-function** mutation in *both* copies of the gene (recessive) can contribute to cancer (e.g., *p53*, *APC*, *Brca1/2*).
*   **Pathways and Treatment:** Most cancers involve mutations that disrupt the same few fundamental regulatory pathways (controlling cell proliferation, survival, growth, and DNA damage response). Understanding these molecular defects is leading to the development of more rational and targeted cancer therapies.
