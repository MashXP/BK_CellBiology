## **I. The Structure of DNA**
*   **DNA as Genetic Material:** Experiments by Griffith, Avery et al., and Hershey and Chase definitively proved that Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is the carrier of genetic information.
*   **The Double Helix:** A DNA molecule consists of two long polynucleotide chains (strands) coiled around each other to form a right-handed double helix.
*   **Composition:** Each strand is a polymer of four nucleotide subunits. Each nucleotide contains a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), or Thymine (T).
*   **Sugar-Phosphate Backbone:** Nucleotides are joined by phosphodiester bonds, which link the 5' carbon of one sugar to the 3' carbon of the next, forming a sugar-phosphate backbone with a distinct chemical polarity (a 5' end and a 3' end).
*   **Complementary Base Pairing:** The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases. Adenine always pairs with Thymine (A-T) via two hydrogen bonds, and Guanine always pairs with Cytosine (G-C) via three hydrogen bonds. This A-T, G-C pairing is known as complementarity.
*   **Antiparallel Strands:** The two strands run in opposite directions; one strand is oriented in the 5'-to-3' direction, while its partner is oriented 3'-to-5'.
*   **Hereditary Mechanism:** The complementary nature of the strands provides a mechanism for DNA replication, as each strand can serve as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand. The sequence of nucleotides along the DNA strand encodes the genetic information.

## **II. The Structure of Eukaryotic Chromosomes**
*   **Chromatin:** In eukaryotes, DNA is not naked but is complexed with proteins (histones and non-histone proteins) to form a compact structure called chromatin.
*   **Histones and Nucleosomes:** The fundamental unit of chromatin packaging is the **nucleosome**. It consists of a protein core made of eight histone molecules (a histone octamer) around which about 147 nucleotide pairs of DNA are wrapped. This gives chromatin a "beads-on-a-string" appearance at the first level of packing.
*   **Levels of Compaction:** Nucleosomes are further packed into a more compact chromatin fiber, which is then folded into a series of looped domains. This multi-level packing allows the enormous length of DNA to fit inside the nucleus.
*   **Interphase vs. Mitotic Chromosomes:**
    *   **Interphase Chromosomes:** Long, thin, and decondensed, occupying distinct territories within the nucleus. This extended state allows access for DNA replication and gene expression.
    *   **Mitotic Chromosomes:** Highly condensed and compact structures visible during cell division (mitosis), which allows for the accurate segregation of duplicated chromosomes to daughter cells.

## **III. Regulation of Chromosome Structure**
*   **Euchromatin and Heterochromatin:** Interphase chromatin is not uniformly packed.
    *   **Euchromatin:** A less condensed form of chromatin, generally associated with regions where genes are actively being expressed.
    *   **Heterochromatin:** A highly condensed form, typically containing few genes and associated with gene silencing. It is often found at centromeres and telomeres.
*   **Dynamic Structure:** The cell can dynamically alter chromatin structure to regulate access to the DNA.
    *   **Chromatin-Remodeling Complexes:** ATP-dependent protein machines that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to slide nucleosomes along the DNA, exposing or hiding specific DNA sequences.
    *   **Histone Modification:** The tails of histone proteins can be reversibly modified by the covalent addition of groups like acetyl, methyl, or phosphate. These modifications act as a "histone code," attracting specific proteins that either condense or decondense chromatin, thereby regulating gene expression.
*   **Inheritance of Chromatin Structure:** Patterns of histone modification can be inherited by daughter cells, allowing for "cell memory" that maintains cell identity. **X-inactivation**, where one X chromosome in female mammals is permanently silenced by conversion to heterochromatin, is a large-scale example of this regulation.
