# **Summary: Chapter 12 - Transport Across Cell Membranes**

## **I. Principles of Transmembrane Transport**
*   **Selective Permeability:** The lipid bilayer is impermeable to ions and most large, uncharged polar molecules. It is permeable to small, nonpolar molecules (like O₂ and CO₂) and, to a lesser extent, small, uncharged polar molecules (like H₂O).
*   **Membrane Transport Proteins:** To transport other necessary molecules (ions, sugars, amino acids), cells rely on two main classes of membrane transport proteins:
    1.  **Transporters:** Bind to a specific solute and undergo a series of conformational changes to transfer it across the membrane.
    2.  **Channels:** Form a narrow hydrophilic pore through the membrane, allowing specific solutes (mainly ions) to pass through. They are much faster than transporters.
*   **Passive vs. Active Transport:**
    *   **Passive Transport:** The movement of a solute down its concentration or electrochemical gradient. It requires no energy input and can be mediated by both channels and transporters.
    *   **Active Transport:** The movement of a solute *against* its concentration or electrochemical gradient. This process requires energy and is exclusively carried out by transporters called **pumps**.
*   **Electrochemical Gradient:** For charged solutes (ions), transport is driven by the **electrochemical gradient**, which is the combined influence of the solute's concentration gradient and the **membrane potential** (the voltage difference across the membrane).

## **II. Transporters and Their Functions**
*   **Passive Transporters:** For example, the glucose transporter moves glucose down its concentration gradient by switching between conformations that expose the glucose-binding site to either side of the membrane.
*   **Pumps and Active Transport:** Pumps use an energy source to move solutes against their electrochemical gradient. There are three main types:
    1.  **ATP-Driven Pumps:** Use the energy from ATP hydrolysis. The **Na⁺-K⁺ pump** is a critical example in animal cells; it uses ATP to pump Na⁺ out and K⁺ in, maintaining steep electrochemical gradients for both ions. **Ca²⁺ pumps** actively pump Ca²⁺ out of the cytosol.
    2.  **Gradient-Driven Pumps:** Couple the downhill movement of one solute to the uphill movement of another. A **symport** moves both solutes in the same direction (e.g., glucose-Na⁺ symport), while an **antiport** moves them in opposite directions (e.g., Na⁺-H⁺ exchanger).
    3.  **Light-Driven Pumps:** Use energy from light to drive transport, found mainly in bacteria.

## **III. Ion Channels and the Membrane Potential**
*   **Ion Channels:** Form ion-selective, gated pores across the membrane.
    *   **Ion Selectivity:** Channels have a narrow **selectivity filter** that allows only specific ions of the appropriate size and charge to pass.
    *   **Gating:** Ion channels are not continuously open. They switch between open and closed states in response to a specific stimulus. Types of gating include **voltage-gated**, **ligand-gated** (extracellular or intracellular ligand), and **mechanically-gated**.
*   **Membrane Potential:** Caused by a slight imbalance of charge across the membrane. The **resting membrane potential** in animal cells is primarily established by the outflow of K⁺ ions through **K⁺ leak channels**, which makes the inside of the cell negative relative to the outside.

## **IV. Ion Channels and Nerve Cell Signaling**
*   **Neurons and Action Potentials:** Neurons use electrical signals called **action potentials** (or nerve impulses) for rapid, long-distance communication. An action potential is a transient, self-propagating wave of membrane depolarization.
*   **Mechanism of an Action Potential:**
    1.  A stimulus causes a sufficient **depolarization** of the membrane to reach a threshold potential.
    2.  This triggers the rapid opening of **voltage-gated Na⁺ channels**. The influx of Na⁺ further depolarizes the membrane, causing a spike in the membrane potential.
    3.  The Na⁺ channels quickly inactivate, and voltage-gated K⁺ channels open.
    4.  The efflux of K⁺ ions repolarizes the membrane, returning it to its negative resting potential.
*   **Synaptic Transmission:** Neurons transmit signals to other cells at specialized junctions called **synapses**.
    1.  The arrival of an action potential at a nerve terminal opens **voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels**.
    2.  The influx of Ca²⁺ triggers the release of chemical signals called **neurotransmitters** into the synaptic cleft.
    3.  The neurotransmitter binds to **transmitter-gated ion channels** on the postsynaptic cell membrane.
    4.  This converts the chemical signal back into an electrical signal by changing the postsynaptic membrane potential, either exciting (e.g., via Na⁺ influx) or inhibiting (e.g., via Cl⁻ influx) the postsynaptic cell.
*   **Optogenetics:** A revolutionary technique that uses light-gated ion channels (like channelrhodopsin) introduced into specific neurons to control their activity with light, allowing for the dissection of complex neural circuits.
