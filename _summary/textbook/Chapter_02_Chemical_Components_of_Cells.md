# **Summary: Chapter 2 - Chemical Components of Cells**

## **I. Chemical Bonds and Atomic Composition**
*   **Atoms:** The fundamental units of elements, composed of a positively charged nucleus (protons and neutrons) and a cloud of negatively charged electrons. The number of protons (atomic number) defines the element.
*   **Key Elements in Cells:** Life is overwhelmingly carbon-based. Four elements—Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and Oxygen (O)—constitute about 96% of a cell's weight.
*   **Electron Shells and Reactivity:** An atom's chemical behavior is determined by the electrons in its outermost shell. Atoms are most stable when this shell is full, and they interact to achieve this stability.
*   **Covalent Bonds:** Form when two atoms *share* one or more pairs of electrons to fill their outer shells. These are strong bonds essential for forming stable molecules.
    *   **Polar vs. Nonpolar:** Electrons may be shared unequally in a *polar covalent bond* (e.g., O-H) due to differences in electronegativity, creating partial positive (δ+) and negative (δ-) charges. In *nonpolar covalent bonds* (e.g., C-H), electrons are shared more equally.
*   **Ionic Bonds:** Form when electrons are completely *transferred* from one atom to another, creating charged ions (cations and anions) that are held together by electrostatic attraction. These form salts like NaCl.

## **II. The Importance of Water and Weak Bonds**
*   **Aqueous Environment:** Cells are ~70% water, and life's chemistry occurs in this aqueous environment. Water's polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds are critical.
*   **Weak Noncovalent Bonds:** While individually weak, multiple noncovalent bonds collectively create strong and highly specific interactions between molecules. They are crucial for the structure and function of macromolecules.
    *   **Hydrogen Bonds:** Form between a hydrogen atom in a polar covalent bond and a negatively charged atom (usually O or N). Responsible for water's unique properties and stabilizing biological structures.
    *   **Electrostatic Attractions:** Occur between fully or partially charged groups.
    *   **Van der Waals Attractions:** Weak, nonspecific attractions that occur when any two atoms are very close.
    *   **Hydrophobic Force:** A "pushing" of nonpolar surfaces out of the hydrogen-bonded water network, causing nonpolar molecules to aggregate. This is not a true bond but is critical for membrane formation and protein folding.
*   **Acids and Bases:** Substances that release protons (H⁺) in water are acids, while those that accept protons are bases. The concentration of H⁺ is measured by the pH scale. Cells maintain a near-neutral pH using buffers.

## **III. The Four Major Families of Small Organic Molecules (Monomers)**
*   **Sugars (Carbohydrates):**
    *   **Structure:** Monosaccharides (e.g., glucose) with the general formula (CH₂O)ₙ.
    *   **Linkage:** Joined by glycosidic bonds through condensation reactions to form disaccharides and polysaccharides.
    *   **Function:** Primary source of chemical energy and can be used for structural support (e.g., cellulose) or energy storage (e.g., glycogen).
*   **Fatty Acids:**
    *   **Structure:** Amphipathic molecules with a hydrophilic carboxylic acid head and a long, hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail. Can be *saturated* (no double bonds) or *unsaturated* (one or more double bonds).
    *   **Function:** Concentrated energy storage (as triacylglycerols) and the core components of cell membranes (as phospholipids).
*   **Amino Acids:**
    *   **Structure:** Central α-carbon bonded to an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable side chain (R group).
    *   **Linkage:** The 20 common types of amino acids are linked by peptide bonds to form polypeptide chains (proteins).
    *   **Function:** The building blocks of proteins. The diverse chemical properties of the side chains give proteins their vast functional range.
*   **Nucleotides:**
    *   **Structure:** A nitrogen-containing base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA), and one or more phosphate groups.
    *   **Linkage:** Joined by phosphodiester bonds to form nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).
    *   **Function:** Subunits of the informational macromolecules DNA and RNA. Crucial for short-term energy transfer, most notably as **ATP** (adenosine triphosphate).

## **IV. Macromolecules in the Cell**
*   **Polymers from Monomers:** Macromolecules (proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides) are polymers formed by the repetitive linking of small monomer subunits through condensation reactions.
*   **Sequence Determines Function:** The specific sequence of subunits in a polymer chain dictates its unique biological function.
*   **Conformation through Noncovalent Bonds:** A polypeptide or RNA chain folds into a specific, stable three-dimensional shape, or **conformation**, which is determined by its amino acid/nucleotide sequence. This folding is stabilized by a multitude of noncovalent bonds.
*   **Specificity of Binding:** The unique conformation of a macromolecule creates specific binding sites that allow it to interact with select other molecules (ligands), which is the basis for all biological activity.
