# **Summary: Chapter 7 - From DNA to Protein**

## **I. From DNA to RNA (Transcription)**
*   **The Central Dogma:** The flow of genetic information in cells is from DNA to RNA (transcription) and then from RNA to protein (translation).
*   **Transcription:** The process of copying a segment of DNA (a gene) into an RNA molecule.
    *   **RNA vs. DNA:** RNA is chemically different from DNA in two ways: it contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose, and it uses the base Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T). RNA is typically single-stranded.
    *   **RNA Polymerase:** The enzyme that carries out transcription. It unwinds a small portion of the DNA double helix to expose a template strand and synthesizes a complementary RNA copy in the 5'-to-3' direction. Unlike DNA polymerase, it does not require a primer.
    *   **Initiation and Termination:** In bacteria, a **sigma factor** subunit helps RNA polymerase recognize a specific DNA sequence called a **promoter** to start transcription. Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a **terminator** sequence. In eukaryotes, transcription initiation is more complex, requiring a set of proteins called **general transcription factors** that assemble at the promoter.
*   **Types of RNA:** Cells produce various types of RNA. **Messenger RNAs (mRNAs)** code for proteins, while noncoding RNAs like **ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs)** and **transfer RNAs (tRNAs)** are functional end products involved in translation.

## **II. RNA Processing in Eukaryotes**
*   **Nuclear Processing:** In eukaryotes, RNA is transcribed and processed in the nucleus before being exported to the cytosol for translation.
*   **Eukaryotic Gene Structure:** Most eukaryotic genes are interrupted by noncoding sequences called **introns**, which separate the coding sequences, or **exons**.
*   **RNA Processing Steps:** Before an mRNA is considered mature, it undergoes three main processing steps:
    1.  **5' Capping:** A modified guanine nucleotide is added to the 5' end of the RNA transcript. This cap helps stabilize the mRNA and is recognized by the translation machinery.
    2.  **RNA Splicing:** Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA, and the exons are stitched together. This process is carried out by the **spliceosome**, a large complex of proteins and **small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs)**. **Alternative splicing** allows different proteins to be produced from the same gene.
    3.  **3' Polyadenylation:** A long chain of adenine nucleotides (a **poly-A tail**) is added to the 3' end of the transcript, which helps stabilize the mRNA.
*   **Export:** Only correctly processed, mature mRNAs are selectively exported from the nucleus to the cytosol through nuclear pore complexes.

## **III. From RNA to Protein (Translation)**
*   **The Genetic Code:** The nucleotide sequence of an mRNA is read in consecutive groups of three nucleotides called **codons**. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid. The code is redundant (multiple codons for one amino acid), contains start (AUG) and stop signals, and is nearly universal among all life.
*   **tRNA Molecules:** Act as molecular adaptors. Each tRNA molecule has an **anticodon** loop that base-pairs with a specific mRNA codon and a 3' end to which the corresponding amino acid is covalently attached. **Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases** are enzymes that correctly charge each tRNA with its proper amino acid.
*   **Ribosomes:** Large macromolecular machines made of ribosomal proteins and rRNAs. They move along an mRNA, capture charged tRNA molecules, and catalyze the formation of peptide bonds to link the amino acids into a polypeptide chain.
    *   A ribosome has a binding site for mRNA and three binding sites for tRNA (A, P, and E sites).
    *   The rRNA molecules (**ribozymes**) form the structural and catalytic core of the ribosome.
*   **Initiation, Elongation, and Termination:** Translation begins at the AUG start codon with the help of **translation initiation factors** and a special initiator tRNA. The ribosome then moves along the mRNA, adding amino acids in a four-step cycle until it reaches a stop codon, where **release factors** bind and terminate the process.

## **IV. RNA and the Origins of Life**
*   **The RNA World Hypothesis:** Proposes that early life was based on RNA, which served as both the genetic material and the primary catalyst, before the evolution of DNA and proteins. Modern ribozymes, like the ribosome's catalytic rRNA, are seen as molecular fossils of this era.
*   **Autocatalysis:** The origin of life requires molecules that can catalyze their own replication. RNA is capable of both storing information (like DNA) and catalyzing reactions (like proteins), making it a plausible candidate for the first self-replicating molecule.
