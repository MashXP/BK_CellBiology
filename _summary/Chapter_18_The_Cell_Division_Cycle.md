# **Summary: Chapter 18 - The Cell-Division Cycle**

## **I. Overview of the Cell Cycle**
*   **The Cell Cycle:** The orderly sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its contents and divides into two genetically identical daughter cells.
*   **Phases of the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle:**
    *   **Interphase:** The period of cell growth and DNA replication between divisions. It consists of:
        *   **G₁ Phase (Gap 1):** Cell growth and monitoring of the environment.
        *   **S Phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs.
        *   **G₂ Phase (Gap 2):** Further growth and preparation for division.
    *   **M Phase:** The period of cell division, which includes:
        *   **Mitosis:** Nuclear division.
        *   **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasmic division.
*   **Cell-Cycle Control System:** A complex network of regulatory proteins that ensures the events of the cell cycle occur in the correct sequence. It uses **checkpoints** to pause the cycle at key transitions (e.g., G₁ to S, G₂ to M) if conditions are not favorable.

## **II. The Cell-Cycle Control System**
*   **Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (Cdks):** The core components of the control system. These are protein kinases whose activity depends on being bound to regulatory proteins called **cyclins**.
*   **Cyclins:** Their concentrations vary in a cyclical fashion during the cell cycle. The cyclic assembly and activation of different **cyclin-Cdk complexes** triggers the different events of the cycle (e.g., S-Cdk triggers S phase, M-Cdk triggers M phase).
*   **Regulation of Cdk Activity:** Cdk activity is regulated by several mechanisms:
    *   **Cyclin Concentration:** Rises due to transcription/translation and falls abruptly due to targeted protein degradation by the **Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC/C)**.
    *   **Phosphorylation:** Activating and inhibitory phosphorylation of the Cdk subunit.
    *   **Cdk Inhibitor Proteins:** Proteins (like p21) that bind to and block the activity of cyclin-Cdk complexes.

## **III. G₁ and S Phases**
*   **G₁ Phase:** A critical decision-making phase. The cell can commit to another cycle, pause, or withdraw into a resting state (**G₀**).
*   **S Phase Initiation:** The transition from G₁ to S is driven by the activation of G₁/S-Cdks and S-Cdks. These complexes are triggered by extracellular signals called **mitogens**. They phosphorylate and inactivate proteins that block progression, such as the **Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein**.
*   **DNA Damage Checkpoint:** If DNA damage is detected in G₁, the protein **p53** is activated. It induces the expression of a Cdk inhibitor, p21, which arrests the cell cycle in G₁, allowing time for DNA repair.
*   **S Phase:** The **origin recognition complex (ORC)** recruits proteins to form a prereplicative complex at replication origins in G₁. **S-Cdk** then triggers the initiation of DNA replication and prevents re-replication by phosphorylating key initiation proteins.

## **IV. M Phase: Mitosis and Cytokinesis**
*   **M-Cdk Activation:** Triggers entry into mitosis via a positive feedback loop. M-Cdk phosphorylates a vast array of proteins to orchestrate the events of mitosis.
*   **Chromosome Condensation and Segregation:**
    *   **Cohesins:** Protein rings that hold the two replicated **sister chromatids** together after S phase.
    *   **Condensins:** Protein rings that help condense each individual chromatid into a compact form at the start of M phase.
*   **Cytoskeletal Machines:** Two transient structures carry out M phase:
    1.  **The Mitotic Spindle:** Made of microtubules; responsible for separating the duplicated chromosomes during **mitosis**.
    2.  **The Contractile Ring:** Made of actin and myosin filaments; responsible for dividing the cytoplasm in two during **cytokinesis** in animal cells.
*   **Stages of Mitosis:**
    *   **Prophase:** Chromosomes condense, and the mitotic spindle begins to form.
    *   **Prometaphase:** The nuclear envelope breaks down, and spindle microtubules attach to chromosomes at their **kinetochores**.
    *   **Metaphase:** Chromosomes are aligned at the metaphase plate, midway between the spindle poles.
    *   **Anaphase:** Sister chromatids separate and are pulled to opposite spindle poles. This is triggered by the **APC/C**, which targets the cohesin linkage for destruction.
    *   **Telophase:** The two sets of chromosomes arrive at the poles, and the nuclear envelope re-forms.
*   **Cytokinesis:** In animal cells, the contractile ring pinches the cell in two. In plant cells, a new cell wall is formed between the daughter cells, guided by a structure called the phragmoplast.

## **V. Control of Cell Numbers and Cell Size**
*   **Apoptosis:** A neat and tidy form of programmed cell death mediated by a family of proteases called **caspases**. It eliminates unwanted or damaged cells without causing inflammation.
*   **Extracellular Control:** In multicellular animals, cell numbers and size are controlled by extracellular signals:
    *   **Survival Factors:** Suppress apoptosis.
    *   **Mitogens:** Stimulate cell division by overcoming the brakes on cell-cycle progression in G₁.
    *   **Growth Factors:** Stimulate cell growth (increase in cell mass) by promoting macromolecule synthesis and inhibiting their degradation.
