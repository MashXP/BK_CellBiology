# **Summary: Chapter 15 - Intracellular Compartments and Protein Transport**

## **I. Membrane-Enclosed Organelles**
*   **Compartmentalization:** Eukaryotic cells are subdivided by internal membranes into functionally distinct, membrane-enclosed organelles (e.g., nucleus, ER, Golgi, lysosomes).
*   **Evolutionary Origins:** The nuclear membranes and the **endomembrane system** (ER, Golgi, peroxisomes, endosomes, lysosomes) likely originated from invagination of the plasma membrane. Mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have evolved from engulfed bacteria (endosymbiosis).

## **II. Protein Sorting**
*   **Protein Synthesis and Targeting:** Most proteins are synthesized on ribosomes in the cytosol. Their subsequent destination depends on **sorting signals** (specific amino acid sequences) within their structure. Proteins without a sorting signal remain in the cytosol.
*   **Mechanisms of Protein Import:**
    1.  **Transport through Nuclear Pores:** Proteins destined for the nucleus contain a **nuclear localization signal**. They are actively transported through **nuclear pore complexes** in their fully folded conformation, a process powered by GTP hydrolysis involving the Ran GTPase.
    2.  **Transport Across Membranes:** Proteins entering mitochondria, chloroplasts, the ER, or peroxisomes are threaded across the membrane(s) through **protein translocators**. These proteins must typically unfold to be transported.
    3.  **Transport by Vesicles:** Proteins move between compartments of the endomembrane system via **transport vesicles**.

## **III. Vesicular Transport**
*   **Vesicle Budding:** Transport vesicles bud from one membrane and fuse with another. The budding process is driven by the assembly of a protein coat on the cytosolic surface.
    *   **Coated Vesicles:** **Clathrin-coated vesicles** (budding from the Golgi and plasma membrane) and **COP-coated vesicles** (budding from the ER and Golgi) are two major types. The coat helps shape the vesicle and capture specific cargo molecules via **adaptins** and cargo receptors.
*   **Vesicle Docking and Fusion:**
    *   **Tethering and Docking:** The specificity of transport is ensured by **Rab proteins** on the vesicle surface, which are recognized by **tethering proteins** on the target membrane.
    *   **Fusion:** **SNARE proteins** (v-SNAREs on the vesicle and t-SNAREs on the target membrane) mediate the final docking and catalyze the fusion of the two lipid bilayers.

## **IV. Secretory Pathways (Exocytosis)**
*   **ER Processing:** Proteins entering the secretory pathway are synthesized on the ER membrane. In the ER lumen, they fold, assemble into multisubunit proteins, form disulfide bonds, and undergo **N-linked glycosylation** (attachment of a pre-formed oligosaccharide).
*   **ER Quality Control:** Misfolded or improperly assembled proteins are retained in the ER by **chaperone proteins** and eventually degraded. An accumulation of misfolded proteins triggers the **unfolded protein response (UPR)**.
*   **Golgi Apparatus:** Proteins and lipids are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, where they are further modified, sorted in the **trans Golgi network**, and dispatched to their final destinations.
*   **Exocytosis:** Vesicles from the Golgi fuse with the plasma membrane.
    *   **Constitutive Pathway:** A continuous process that supplies the plasma membrane with new lipids and proteins and secretes substances into the extracellular space.
    *   **Regulated Pathway:** Operates only in specialized secretory cells. It stores selected proteins in **secretory vesicles** and releases them only in response to an extracellular signal.

## **V. Endocytic Pathways (Endocytosis)**
*   **Endocytosis:** The process by which cells take up fluid, molecules, and particles from the extracellular environment.
    *   **Phagocytosis ("cellular eating"):** The ingestion of large particles (e.g., microorganisms) via large vesicles called phagosomes.
    *   **Pinocytosis ("cellular drinking"):** The ingestion of fluid and small molecules via small vesicles. **Receptor-mediated endocytosis** is a highly efficient form of pinocytosis that uses specific receptors to concentrate molecules for uptake (e.g., cholesterol uptake via LDL receptors).
*   **Endosomes and Lysosomes:** Endocytosed material is first delivered to **endosomes**, where it is sorted. Receptors are often recycled back to the plasma membrane, while the cargo is delivered to **lysosomes** for degradation. Lysosomes are the principal sites of intracellular digestion, containing a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that function at an acidic pH.
