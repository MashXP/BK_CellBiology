# **Summary: Chapter 13 - How Cells Obtain Energy from Food**

## **I. General Principles of Catabolism**
*   **Stepwise Oxidation:** Cells break down food molecules (sugars, fats) in a series of controlled, enzyme-catalyzed steps. This stepwise oxidation allows the cell to capture a significant portion of the released energy in activated carriers, rather than losing it all as heat.
*   **Three Stages of Food Breakdown:**
    1.  **Stage 1 (Digestion):** Large polymers (proteins, polysaccharides, fats) are broken down into their smaller monomer subunits (amino acids, sugars, fatty acids). This occurs mostly outside cells or in lysosomes.
    2.  **Stage 2 (Glycolysis and Pyruvate Oxidation):** Starts in the cytosol with **glycolysis**, which breaks down glucose into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a small amount of ATP and NADH. Pyruvate then moves into the mitochondrial matrix and is converted into acetyl CoA and CO₂.
    3.  **Stage 3 (Citric Acid Cycle and Oxidative Phosphorylation):** Occurs entirely in the mitochondria. The acetyl group of acetyl CoA is completely oxidized to CO₂ by the **citric acid cycle**, producing large amounts of NADH and FADH₂. These high-energy electrons are then passed to the **electron-transport chain** to drive **oxidative phosphorylation**, the process that generates the vast majority of the cell's ATP.

## **II. Glycolysis and Fermentation**
*   **Glycolysis:** A central metabolic pathway that occurs in the cytosol and does not require oxygen.
    *   **Process:** A single molecule of glucose (6 carbons) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons) through a sequence of 10 enzymatic reactions.
    *   **Net Yield:** For each molecule of glucose, glycolysis yields 2 ATP and 2 NADH. The ATP is produced by **substrate-level phosphorylation**.
*   **Fermentation:** An anaerobic process that occurs in the cytosol when oxygen is absent.
    *   **Purpose:** To regenerate the NAD⁺ consumed during glycolysis, allowing glycolysis to continue producing ATP.
    *   **Products:** Pyruvate is converted into excretable products like lactate (in muscle cells) or ethanol and CO₂ (in yeast). No additional ATP is produced.

## **III. The Citric Acid Cycle and Fat Breakdown**
*   **Pyruvate to Acetyl CoA:** In the mitochondrial matrix, the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex converts pyruvate into acetyl CoA, producing CO₂ and NADH. Fatty acids are also broken down in the matrix to produce large amounts of acetyl CoA.
*   **The Citric Acid Cycle (Krebs Cycle):**
    *   **Location:** Mitochondrial matrix.
    *   **Process:** The acetyl group from acetyl CoA is transferred to oxaloacetate to form citrate. Through a cycle of eight reactions, the acetyl group is completely oxidized to two molecules of CO₂.
    *   **Net Yield (per turn):** 3 NADH, 1 GTP, and 1 FADH₂.
*   **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** The final stage where NADH and FADH₂ donate their high-energy electrons to the electron-transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This process, which requires oxygen, ultimately generates the bulk of the ATP from food oxidation.

## **IV. Regulation and Storage of Food Molecules**
*   **Metabolic Precursors:** Intermediates from glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are siphoned off to serve as the building blocks for the synthesis of many other essential molecules, including amino acids, nucleotides, and lipids.
*   **Feedback Regulation:** Metabolic pathways are tightly regulated. Cells can switch between glucose breakdown (glycolysis) and glucose synthesis (**gluconeogenesis**) through feedback mechanisms that control the activity of key enzymes.
*   **Food Storage:**
    *   **Animals:** Store glucose as the branched polymer **glycogen** (mainly in liver and muscle cells) and store fats as **triacylglycerols** in lipid droplets within adipocytes. Fat is a more compact and richer energy source than glycogen.
    *   **Plants:** Store sugars as **starch** and fats (oils), often in large quantities in seeds.
