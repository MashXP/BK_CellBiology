# Cell Cycle: Division and Regulation Study Guide

## 1. Overview of the Cell-Division Cycle

### 1.1 The Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
*   **Definition:** The essential mechanism by which all living things reproduce. The cell replicates its contents and divides in two.
*   **Duration:** Varies significantly by cell type (Table 18-1).
    *   **Early fly embryo cells:** 8 minutes.
    *   **Early frog embryo cells:** 30 minutes.
    *   **Mammalian intestinal epithelial cells:** ~12 hours.
    *   **Mammalian fibroblasts in culture:** ~20 hours.

### 1.2 Four Phases of the Eukaryotic Cell Cycle
The cycle is divided into two major periods: Interphase and M Phase.
1.  **M Phase (Mitosis and Cytokinesis):**
    *   **Mitosis:** Nuclear division.
    *   **Cytokinesis:** Cytoplasmic division.
2.  **Interphase:** The period between one M phase and the next. It constitutes the majority of the cell cycle and consists of three phases:
    *   **G1 Phase (Gap 1):** Cell growth and monitoring of the environment.
    *   **S Phase (Synthesis):** DNA replication occurs.
    *   **G2 Phase (Gap 2):** Further growth and preparation for mitosis.

### 1.3 The Cell-Cycle Control System
*   **Function:** Ensures key processes occur in the proper sequence and that the cell is ready for the next stage.
*   **Key Checkpoints:**
    1.  **G1 to S Transition (Start):**
        *   Checks: Is the environment favorable?
        *   Action: Enter S Phase.
    2.  **G2 to M Transition:**
        *   Checks: Is all DNA replicated? Is all DNA damage repaired?
        *   Action: Enter Mitosis.
    3.  **Metaphase-to-Anaphase Transition:**
        *   Checks: Are all chromosomes properly attached to the mitotic spindle?
        *   Action: Pull duplicated chromosomes apart.

## 2. Molecular Regulation of the Cell Cycle

### 2.1 Cyclin-Dependent Protein Kinases (Cdks)
*   **Mechanism:** Progression through the cycle depends on Cdks.
*   **Activation:** Cdks are inactive unless bound to a **cyclin** protein.
*   **Cyclin-Cdk Complex:**
    *   **Cyclin:** Its concentration varies cyclically during the cell cycle (hence the name).
    *   **Cdk:** Its concentration remains relatively constant, but its *activity* rises and falls as cyclin levels change.
*   **Function:** The active Cyclin-Cdk complex phosphorylates key proteins to trigger cell cycle events.

### 2.2 Major Cyclins and Cdks in Vertebrates (Table 18-2)
*   **G1-Cdk:**
    *   **Cyclin:** Cyclin D (D1, D2, D3).
    *   **Cdk Partner:** Cdk4, Cdk6.
*   **G1/S-Cdk:**
    *   **Cyclin:** Cyclin E.
    *   **Cdk Partner:** Cdk2.
*   **S-Cdk:**
    *   **Cyclin:** Cyclin A.
    *   **Cdk Partner:** Cdk2.
*   **M-Cdk:**
    *   **Cyclin:** Cyclin B.
    *   **Cdk Partner:** Cdk1.

### 2.3 Regulation of Cdk Activity
1.  **Cyclin Degradation:**
    *   **Ubiquitylation:** The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) tags cyclins with ubiquitin chains.
    *   **Proteasome:** The marked cyclins are destroyed in the proteasome, inactivating the Cdk.
    *   **Purpose:** Ensures the cell cycle moves forward irreversibly.
2.  **Phosphorylation/Dephosphorylation:**
    *   **Inhibitory Phosphates:** For M-Cdk to be active, inhibitory phosphates must be removed.
    *   **Wee1 (Inhibitory Kinase):** Adds inhibitory phosphate.
    *   **Cdc25 (Activating Phosphatase):** Removes the inhibitory phosphate, activating the M-Cdk.
    *   **Positive Feedback Loop:** Active M-Cdk phosphorylates and activates Cdc25, which in turn activates more M-Cdk.
3.  **Cdk Inhibitor Proteins (CKIs):**
    *   **Mechanism:** Binding of an inhibitor protein (e.g., p27) to the Cyclin-Cdk complex blocks its activity.
    *   **Function:** Used to pause the cycle at specific transition points (e.g., G1 checkpoint).

### 2.4 Checkpoint Control Mechanisms
*   **G1 Checkpoint (Start):**
    *   **Inhibitor:** Cdk inhibitors block entry to S phase if the environment is unfavorable.
*   **G2 Checkpoint:**
    *   **Inhibitor:** Inhibition of activating phosphatase (Cdc25) blocks entry to Mitosis if DNA replication is incomplete or DNA is damaged.
*   **M Checkpoint (Spindle Assembly Checkpoint):**
    *   **Inhibitor:** Inhibition of APC/C activation delays exit from mitosis if chromosomes are not properly attached to the spindle.

## 3. G1 Phase and S Phase Initiation

### 3.1 The G1 Decision Point
*   At the G1-to-S transition, a cell can:
    1.  Proceed to S phase.
    2.  Pause.
    3.  Withdraw to G0 (a resting state).
    4.  Withdraw permanently and terminally differentiate.

### 3.2 Mitogen Signaling
*   **Mitogens:** Extracellular signals that stimulate cell proliferation.
*   **Rb Protein (Retinoblastoma):** An inhibitor of cell proliferation. It binds to and inhibits transcription regulators needed for cell proliferation genes.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  Mitogen binds to receptor.
    2.  Intracellular signaling pathway activates G1-Cdk and G1/S-Cdk.
    3.  Active Cdks phosphorylate Rb protein.
    4.  Inactivated (phosphorylated) Rb releases transcription regulators.
    5.  Transcription of genes for entry into S phase occurs.

### 3.3 DNA Damage Checkpoint (G1)
*   **p53 Protein:** A transcription regulator activated by DNA damage.
*   **Mechanism:**
    1.  DNA damage activates protein kinases that phosphorylate and stabilize p53.
    2.  Active p53 binds to the regulatory region of the *p21* gene.
    3.  **p21 (Cdk Inhibitor):** Transcription and translation of p21 occur.
    4.  p21 binds to G1/S-Cdk and S-Cdk, inactivating them.
    5.  **Result:** Cell cycle arrests in G1, allowing time for repair.
    *   *Note:* If DNA damage is too severe, p53 can trigger apoptosis. In the absence of damage, p53 is degraded.

### 3.4 Initiation of DNA Replication (S Phase)
*   Occurs in two steps:
    1.  **Origin Loading (G1 Phase):**
        *   **ORC (Origin Recognition Complex):** Sits on the origin of replication.
        *   **Cdc6:** Binds to ORC and recruits DNA helicase.
        *   **Prereplicative Complex (preRC):** Formed when helicase binds (Cdc6 dissociates). The origin is "loaded."
    2.  **Origin Firing (S Phase):**
        *   **S-Cdk:** Triggers firing.
        *   Activates helicase.
        *   Recruits replication machinery (DNA polymerase, etc.).
        *   **Result:** DNA replication begins at the replication fork.

## 4. M Phase (Mitosis and Cytokinesis)

### 4.1 Chromosome Configuration
*   **Sister Chromatids:** Duplicated chromosomes held together.
*   **Cohesins:** Protein rings that hold sister chromatids together along their length.
*   **Condensins:** Protein rings that help coil and condense chromosomes to make them more compact for segregation.

### 4.2 Cytoskeletal Structures in M Phase
1.  **Mitotic Spindle:**
    *   Composed of **microtubules**.
    *   Function: Separates chromosomes.
2.  **Contractile Ring:**
    *   Composed of **actin and myosin filaments**.
    *   Function: Divides the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) by pinching the cell in two.

### 4.3 Stages of M Phase (Animal Cell)
1.  **Prophase:**
    *   Chromosomes condense.
    *   Mitotic spindle assembles between two centrosomes which move apart.
2.  **Prometaphase:**
    *   Nuclear envelope breaks down.
    *   Chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules via **kinetochores**.
    *   Chromosomes undergo active movement.
3.  **Metaphase:**
    *   Chromosomes align at the equator (metaphase plate) midway between spindle poles.
    *   Kinetochore microtubules on each sister chromatid attach to opposite poles.
4.  **Anaphase:**
    *   Sister chromatids separate synchronously.
    *   They are pulled toward the spindle pole they are attached to.
    *   Kinetochore microtubules shorten; spindle poles move apart.
5.  **Telophase:**
    *   Chromosomes arrive at poles.
    *   Nuclear envelope reassembles around each set, forming two nuclei.
    *   Contractile ring begins to assemble.
6.  **Cytokinesis:**
    *   Cytoplasm is divided in two by the contractile ring.
    *   Nuclear envelope is fully formed around decondensing chromosomes.

### 4.4 Mitotic Spindle Assembly
*   **Centrosome Duplication:**
    *   Centrosome (microtubule-organizing center) duplicates during interphase (S/G2) to form two poles.
    *   **Asters:** Radial arrays of microtubules forming at each pole.
*   **Bipolar Spindle Formation:**
    *   **Selective Stabilization:** Interacting microtubules from opposite poles are stabilized (interpolar microtubules).
    *   **Motor Proteins:** Help crosslink and organize microtubules.
    *   *Note:* Spindles can form without centrosomes (via motor proteins and chromosomes), but centrosomes facilitate the process.
*   **Three Classes of Microtubules:**
    1.  **Astral Microtubules:** Radiate outward from poles.
    2.  **Kinetochore Microtubules:** Attach to kinetochores on chromosomes.
    3.  **Interpolar Microtubules:** Overlap in the center and push poles apart.

### 4.5 Chromosome Attachment
*   **Kinetochore:** A protein complex at the centromere of each chromatid.
*   **Attachment:** Plus ends of microtubules attach to the kinetochore.
*   **Bi-orientation:** Sister chromatids must attach to opposite poles to ensure proper segregation. Tension is generated when they are pulled in opposite directions.

### 4.6 Anaphase Mechanisms
*   **Trigger:** **APC/C** triggers separation by promoting the destruction of **securin**.
    *   **Securin:** Inhibits **separase** (a proteolytic enzyme).
    *   **Separase:** When active, it cleaves **cohesin** rings, releasing sister chromatids.
*   **Two Segregation Processes:**
    1.  **Anaphase A:** Chromosomes are pulled poleward (kinetochore microtubules shorten).
    2.  **Anaphase B:** Poles are pushed and pulled apart (sliding force between interpolar microtubules; pulling force at cell cortex).

### 4.7 Nuclear Envelope Dynamics
*   **Breakdown:** Phosphorylation of nuclear pore proteins and lamins during Prometaphase triggers disassembly.
*   **Re-formation:** Dephosphorylation of these proteins during Telophase allows the nuclear envelope to reassemble and fuse.

### 4.8 Cytokinesis (Animal vs. Plant)
*   **Animal Cells:**
    *   **Mechanism:** **Contractile Ring** (actin/myosin) creates a cleavage furrow.
    *   **Positioning:** Dictated by the central spindle (interpolar microtubules).
    *   **Shape Change:** Cells round up during M phase and then divide.
*   **Plant Cells:**
    *   **Mechanism:** **Phragmoplast** (specialized microtubule structure).
    *   **Process:** Guides Golgi-derived vesicles to the center to form a new **cell wall** (cell plate) from the inside out. No contractile ring.
