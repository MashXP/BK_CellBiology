# 2025: Research in Review - Nature Biotechnology

## Overview
This document summarizes the Nature Biotechnology editors' favorite research articles from 2025, highlighting key advancements in gene editing, cell therapy, immunotherapy, and artificial intelligence.

## Key Advancements

### 1. In Vivo Generated Cellular Therapies
*   **Concept:** Engineering a patient's own T cells directly within the body, eliminating the need for complex external manufacturing.
*   **Technology:** 
    *   Targeted lipid nanoparticles used for mRNA delivery to specific T cell subsets for *in vivo* reprogramming.
    *   Shift towards *in vivo*-generated chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) approaches.

### 2. Large-Scale Genome Engineering
*   **New Tools:** Introduction of retrotransposons and bridge recombinases.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Bridge Recombinase:** Rationally engineered to efficiently insert, excise, and invert large DNA regions.
    *   **Retrotransposon + CRISPR-Cas9 Nickase:** Capable of scarlessly inserting DNA ranging from a single base up to 12.7 kilobases.

### 3. In Vivo Base Editing for Rare Diseases
*   **Application:** Customized lipid-nanoparticle-delivered base-editing therapy.
*   **Case Study:** Successfully treated "KJ," an infant with CPS1 deficiency (a rare metabolic disease).
*   **Significance:** Demonstrates a viable path for treating individuals with rare diseases lacking existing medical options.

### 4. Computational Metabolomics
*   **Challenge:** Interpreting mass spectra in untargeted metabolomics (historically only ~2% annotation rate).
*   **Innovation:** A new transformer model built on a high-quality dataset.
*   **Outcome:** Enables annotation for a wide variety of tasks, significantly improving molecular structure characterization.

### 5. Quantum Computing for Drug Discovery
*   **Target:** KRAS protein (historically "undruggable" due to complexity).
*   **Method:** Combined quantum generative models with classical drug-discovery approaches.
*   **Process:** Sampled 1 million compounds via classical-quantum workflow -> screened for pharmacological viability -> yielded 15 candidates.

### 6. Agentic Automation for Laboratory Experiments
*   **Trend:** "Agentic AI" systems using Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline workflows.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Selecting CRISPR systems.
    *   Finding new gene transfer pathways.
*   **Tools:** Resources like "ToolUniverse" are guiding scientists in utilizing AI co-scientists.

### 7. Preclinical Systems: Beyond Animal Models
*   **Context:** FDA planning to phase out animal testing for antibodies and drugs.
*   **Alternative:** Tumor-on-a-chip models.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Complementary to existing models.
    *   Show dynamic immune cell recruitment patterns.
    *   Lower infrastructure requirements (beneficial for low- and middle-income countries).

### 8. Personalized Cancer Vaccines
*   **Progress:** Success in early clinical trials for vaccines tailored to specific tumor mutations.
*   **Results:**
    *   Targeted renal cell carcinoma (9 patients).
    *   Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (8 patients).
*   **Potential:** Validates the ability of personalized vaccines to alter the course of certain cancers.

### 9. Precision Microbiome Programming
*   **Challenge:** Long-term engraftment of engineered microorganisms in the gut.
*   **Solution:** Engineered strain of *Bacteroides vulgatus*.
*   **Mechanism:** Includes a gene module to break down oxalate (compound causing kidney stones).
*   **Result:** Colonized the gut to treat enteric hyperoxaluria without disrupting native microbiota diversity.

### 10. Recombinant Antivenom
*   **Achievement:** Development of a broad-spectrum, nanobody-based recombinant antivenom.
*   **Efficacy:** Neutralized 17 of the 18 most medically relevant elapid snakes in sub-Saharan Africa.
*   **Composition:** Utilized a mixture of only 8 heavy-chain antibodies.
