# **Chapter 1 Questions: Cells, The Fundamental Units of Life**

## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 1–1 (Page 3)**
"Life" is easy to recognize but difficult to define. According to one popular biology text, living things:
1. Are highly organized compared to natural inanimate objects.
2. Display homeostasis, maintaining a relatively constant internal environment.
3. Reproduce themselves.
4. Grow and develop from simple beginnings.
5. Take energy and matter from the environment and transform it.
6. Respond to stimuli.
7. Show adaptation to their environment.
Score a person, a vacuum cleaner, and a potato with respect to these characteristics.

### **QUESTION 1–2 (Page 5)**
Mutations are mistakes in the DNA that change the genetic plan from that of the previous generation. Imagine a shoe factory. Would you expect mistakes (i.e., unintentional changes) in copying the shoe design to lead to improvements in the shoes produced? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 1–3 (Page 8)**
You have embarked on an ambitious research project: to create life in a test tube. You boil up a rich mixture of yeast extract and amino acids in a flask, along with a sprinkling of the inorganic salts known to be essential for life. You seal the flask and allow it to cool. After several months, the liquid is as clear as ever, and there are no signs of life. A friend suggests that excluding the air was a mistake, since most life as we know it requires oxygen. You repeat the experiment, but this time you leave the flask open to the atmosphere. To your great delight, the liquid becomes cloudy after a few days, and, under the microscope, you see beautiful small cells that are clearly growing and dividing. Does this experiment prove that you managed to generate a novel life-form? How might you redesign your experiment to allow air into the flask, yet eliminate the possibility that contamination by airborne microorganisms is the explanation for the results? (For a ready-made answer, look up the classic experiments of Louis Pasteur.)

### **QUESTION 1–4 (Page 14)**
A bacterium weighs about 10⁻¹² g and can divide every 20 minutes. If a single bacterial cell carried on dividing at this rate, how long would it take before the mass of bacteria would equal that of the Earth (6 x 10²⁴ kg)? Contrast your result with the fact that bacteria originated at least 3.5 billion years ago and have been dividing ever since. Explain the apparent paradox. (The number of cells N in a culture at time t is described by the equation N = N₀ × 2ᵗ/ᴳ, where N₀ is the number of cells at zero time, and G is the population doubling time.)

### **QUESTION 1–5 (Page 22)**
Suggest a reason why it would be advantageous for eukaryotic cells to evolve elaborate internal membrane systems that allow them to import substances from the outside, as shown in Figure 1–25.

### **QUESTION 1–6 (Page 24)**
Discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of light and electron microscopy. How could you best visualize a living skin cell, a yeast mitochondrion, a bacterium, and a microtubule?

### **QUESTION 1–7 (Page 29)**
Your next-door neighbor has donated $100 in support of cancer research and is horrified to learn that her money is being spent on studying brewer's yeast. How could you put her mind at ease?

### **QUESTION 1-11 (Page 38)**
There are three major classes of protein filaments that make up the cytoskeleton of a typical animal cell. What are they, and what are the differences in their functions? Which cytoskeletal filaments would be most plentiful in a muscle cell or in an epidermal cell making up the outer layer of the skin? Explain your answers.

### **QUESTION 1-12 (Page 38)**
Natural selection is such a powerful force in evolution because organisms or cells with even a small reproductive advantage will eventually outnumber their competitors. To illustrate how quickly this process can occur, consider a cell culture that contains 1 million bacterial cells that double every 20 minutes. A single cell in this culture acquires a mutation that allows it to divide faster, with a generation time of only 15 minutes. Assuming that there is an unlimited food supply and no cell death, how long would it take before the progeny of the mutated cell became predominant in the culture? (Before you go through the calculation, make a guess: do you think it would take about a day, a week, a month, or a year?) How many cells of either type are present in the culture at this time? (The number of cells N in the culture at time t is described by the equation N = N₀ x 2ᵗ/ᴳ, where N₀ is the number of cells at zero time and G is the generation time.)

### **QUESTION 1-13 (Page 38)**
When bacteria are cultured under adverse conditions—for example, in the presence of a poison such as an antibiotic—most cells grow and divide slowly. But it is not uncommon to find that the rate of proliferation is restored to normal after a few days. Suggest why this may be the case.

### **QUESTION 1-14 (Page 38)**
Apply the principle of exponential growth of a population of cells in a culture (as described in Question 1-12) to the cells in a multicellular organism, such as yourself. There are about 10¹³ cells in your body. Assume that one cell has acquired mutations that allow it to divide in an uncontrolled manner to become a cancer cell. Some cancer cells can proliferate with a generation time of about 24 hours. If none of the cancer cells died, how long would it take before 10¹³ cells in your body would be cancer cells? (Use the equation N = N₀ × 2ᵗ/ᴳ, with t the time and G the generation time. Hint: 10¹³ ≈ 2⁴³.)

### **QUESTION 1-15 (Page 38)**
"The structure and function of a living cell are dictated by the laws of chemistry, physics, and thermodynamics." Provide examples that support (or refute) this claim.

### **QUESTION 1-16 (Page 38)**
What, if any, are the advantages in being multicellular?

### **QUESTION 1-17 (Page 38)**
Draw to scale the outline of two spherical cells, one a bacterium with a diameter of 1 µm, the other an animal cell with a diameter of 15 µm. Calculate the volume, surface area, and surface-to-volume ratio for each cell. How would the latter ratio change if you included the internal membranes of the animal cell in the calculation of surface area (assume internal membranes have 15 times the area of the plasma membrane)? (The volume of a sphere is given by 4πr³/3 and its surface by 4πr², where r is its radius.) Discuss the following hypothesis: “Internal membranes allowed bigger cells to evolve."

### **QUESTION 1-18 (Page 38)**
What are the arguments that all living cells evolved from a common ancestor cell? Imagine the very "early days" of evolution of life on Earth. Would you assume that the primordial ancestor cell was the first and only cell to form?

### **QUESTION 1-19 (Page 38)**
Looking at some pond water with a light microscope, you notice an unfamiliar rod-shaped cell about 200 µm long. Knowing that some exceptional bacteria can be as big as this or even bigger, you wonder whether your cell is a bacterium or a eukaryote. How will you decide? If it is not a eukaryote, how will you discover whether it is a bacterium or an archaeon?

### **QUESTION 2–1 (Page 4)**
A cup containing exactly 18 g, or 1 mole, of water was emptied into the Aegean Sea 3000 years ago.

### **QUESTION 2–2 (Page 5)**
A carbon atom contains six protons and six neutrons.
A. What are its atomic number and atomic weight?
B. How many electrons does it have?
C. How many additional electrons must it add to fill its outermost shell? How does this affect carbon's chemical behavior?
D. Carbon with an atomic weight of 14 is radioactive. How does it differ in structure from nonradioactive carbon? How does this difference affect its chemical behavior?

### **QUESTION 2-3 (Page 8)**
Discuss whether the following statement is correct: "An ionic bond can, in principle, be thought of as a very polar covalent bond. Polar covalent bonds, then, fall somewhere between ionic bonds at one end of the spectrum and nonpolar covalent bonds at the other end."

### **QUESTION 2–4 (Page 9)**
True or false? "When NaCl is dissolved in water, the water molecules closest to the ions will tend to preferentially orient themselves so that their oxygen atoms face the sodium ions and face away from the chloride ions." Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 2–5 (Page 12)**

B. If they exist, what is the ratio of H₃O⁺ ions to H₂O molecules at neutral pH? (Hint: the molecular weight of water is 18, and 1 liter of water weighs 1 kg.)

### **QUESTION 2–6 (Page 18)**
Why do you suppose only L-amino acids and not a random mixture of the L- and D-forms of each amino acid are used to make proteins?

### **QUESTION 2-7 (Page 21)**
What is meant by “polarity” of a polypeptide chain and by “polarity” of a chemical bond? How do the meanings differ?

### **QUESTION 2–8 (Page 24)**
In principle, there are many different, chemically diverse ways in which small molecules can be joined together to form polymers. For example, the small molecule ethene (CH₂=CH₂) is used commercially to make the plastic polyethylene (...-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-...). The individual subunits of the three major classes of biological macromolecules, however, are all linked by similar reaction mechanisms—that is, by condensation reactions that eliminate water. Can you think of any benefits that this chemistry offers and why it might have been selected in evolution over a linking chemistry such as that used to produce polyethylene?

### **QUESTION 2-9 (Page 25)**
Why could covalent bonds not be used in place of noncovalent bonds to mediate most of the interactions of macromolecules?

C. What do the answers tell you about the reactivity of helium and the bonds that can form between sodium and chlorine?

### **QUESTION 2-13 (Page 27)**
The elements oxygen and sulfur have similar chemical properties because they both have six electrons in their outermost electron shells. Indeed, both elements form molecules with two hydrogen atoms, water (H₂O) and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). Surprisingly, at room temperature, water is a liquid, yet H₂S is a gas, despite sulfur being much larger and heavier than oxygen. Explain why this might be the case.

### **QUESTION 3–5 (Page 20)**
The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is one of the speediest enzymes known. It catalyzes the rapid conversion of CO₂ gas into the much more soluble bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻). The reaction: CO₂ + H₂O ↔ HCO₃⁻ + H⁺ is very important for the efficient transport of CO₂ from tissues, where CO₂ is produced by respiration, to the lungs, where it is exhaled. Carbonic anhydrase accelerates the reaction 10⁷-fold, hydrating 10⁵ CO₂ molecules per second at its maximal speed. What do you suppose limits the speed of the enzyme? Sketch a diagram analogous to the one shown in Figure 3-13 and indicate which portion of your diagram has been designed to display the 10⁷-fold acceleration.

F. The rule that oxidations release energy, whereas reductions require energy input, applies to all chemical reactions, not just those that occur in living cells.
G. Cold-blooded animals have an energetic disadvantage because they release less heat to the environment than warm-blooded animals do. This slows their ability to make ordered macromolecules.
H. Linking the reaction X → Y to a second, energetically favorable reaction Y → Z will shift the equilibrium constant of the first reaction.

### **QUESTION 3-11 (Page 34)**
Consider a transition of X ↔ Y. Assume that the only difference between X and Y is the presence of three hydrogen bonds in Y that are absent in X. What is the ratio of X to Y when the reaction is in equilibrium? Approximate your answer by using Table 3-1 (p. 96), with 4.2 kJ/mole as the energy of each hydrogen bond. If Y instead has six hydrogen bonds that distinguish it from X, how would that change the ratio?

### **QUESTION 3-12 (Page 34)**

C. How many extra hydrogen bonds would be needed to hold A and B together at this lower concentration so that a similar proportion of the molecules are found in the AB complex? (Remember that each hydrogen bond contributes about 4.2 kJ/mole.)

### **QUESTION 3-13 (Page 34)**
Discuss the following statement: "Whether the ΔG for a reaction is larger, smaller, or the same as ΔG° depends on the concentration of the compounds that participate in the reaction."

### **QUESTION 3-14 (Page 34)**
A. How many ATP molecules could maximally be generated from one molecule of glucose, if the complete oxidation of 1 mole of glucose to CO₂ and H₂O yields 2867 kJ of free energy and the useful chemical energy available in the high-energy phosphate bond of 1 mole of ATP is 50 kJ?
B. As we will see in Chapter 14 (Table 14-1), respiration produces 30 moles of ATP from 1 mole of glucose. Compare this number with your answer in part (A). What is the overall efficiency of ATP production from glucose?

The reaction is normally driven by ATP hydrolysis. Assume that a mutation in the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction prevents it from utilizing ATP, but still allows it to catalyze the reaction.
A. Do you suppose it might be safe for you to eat a mushroom that bears this mutation?
B. Would your answer be different for another mutant mushroom whose enzyme couples the reaction to ATP hydrolysis but works 100 times more slowly?

### **QUESTION 3-18 (Page 35)**
Consider the effects of two enzymes, A and B. Enzyme A catalyzes the reaction ATP + GDP ↔ ADP + GTP and enzyme B catalyzes the reaction NADH + NADP⁺ ↔ NAD⁺ + NADPH. Discuss whether the enzymes would be beneficial or detrimental to cells.

### **QUESTION 3-19 (Page 35)**
Discuss the following statement: “Enzymes and heat are alike in that both can speed up reactions that—although thermodynamically feasible—do not occur at an appreciable rate because they require a high activation energy. Diseases that seem to benefit from the careful application of heat—in the form of hot chicken soup, for example—are therefore likely to be due to the insufficient function of an enzyme.”

### **QUESTION 4–1 (Page 7)**
Urea, used in the experiment shown in Figure 4-7, is a molecule that disrupts the hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules. Why might high concentrations of urea unfold proteins? The structure of urea is shown here: O=C(NH₂)₂.

### **QUESTION 4–2 (Page 11)**
Remembering that the amino acid side chains projecting from each polypeptide backbone in a β sheet point alternately above and below the plane of the sheet (see Figure 4-13A), consider the following protein sequence: Leu-Lys-Val-Asp-Ile-Ser-Leu-Arg-Leu-Lys-Ile-Arg-Phe-Glu. Do you find anything remarkable about the arrangement of the amino acids in this sequence when incorporated into a β sheet?

### **QUESTION 4-3 (Page 16)**
Random mutations only very rarely result in changes that improve a protein's usefulness for the cell, yet useful mutations are selected in evolution. Because these changes are so rare, for each useful mutation there are innumerable mutations that lead to either no improvement or inactive proteins. Why, then, do cells not contain millions of proteins that are of no use?

### **QUESTION 4–4 (Page 21)**
Hair is composed largely of fibers of the protein keratin. Individual keratin fibers are covalently cross-linked to one another by many disulfide (S–S) bonds. If curly hair is treated with mild reducing agents that break a few of the cross-links, pulled straight, and then oxidized again, it remains straight. Draw a diagram that illustrates the three different stages of this chemical and mechanical process at the level of the keratin filaments, focusing on the disulfide bonds. What do you think would happen if hair were treated with strong reducing agents that break all the disulfide bonds?

### **QUESTION 4–5 (Page 27)**
Use drawings to explain how an enzyme (such as hexokinase, mentioned in the text) can distinguish its normal substrate (here, D-glucose) from the optical isomer L-glucose, which is not a substrate. (Hint: remembering that a carbon atom forms four single bonds that are tetrahedrally arranged and that the optical isomers are mirror images of each other around such a bond, draw the substrate as a simple tetrahedron with four different corners and then draw its mirror image. Using this drawing, indicate why only one optical isomer might bind to a schematic active site of an enzyme.)

### **QUESTION 4–6 (Page 34)**
Consider the drawing in Figure 4-42. What will happen if, instead of the indicated feedback,
A. feedback inhibition from Z affects the step B → C only?
B. feedback inhibition from Z affects the step Y → Z only?
C. Z is a positive regulator of the step B → X?

For each case, discuss how useful these regulatory schemes would be for a cell.

### **QUESTION 4–7 (Page 38)**
Either protein phosphorylation or the binding of a nucleotide (such as ATP or GTP) can be used to regulate a protein's activity. What do you suppose are the advantages of each form of regulation?

### **QUESTION 4–8 (Page 40)**
Explain why the hypothetical enzymes in Figure 4-51 have a great advantage in opening the safe if they work together in a protein complex, as opposed to working individually in an unlinked, sequential manner.

G. Noncovalent bonds are too weak to influence the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules.
H. Affinity chromatography separates molecules according to their intrinsic charge.
I. Upon centrifugation of a cell homogenate, smaller organelles experience less friction and thereby sediment faster than larger ones.

What common feature of α helices and β sheets makes them universal building blocks for proteins?

### **QUESTION 4-12 (Page 54)**
Protein structure is determined solely by a protein's amino acid sequence. Should a genetically engineered protein in which the original order of all amino acids is reversed have the same structure as the original protein?

### **QUESTION 4-13 (Page 54)**
Consider the following protein sequence as an α helix: Leu-Lys-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Leu-Phe-Lys-Val. How many turns does this helix make? Do you find anything remarkable about the arrangement of the amino acids in this sequence when folded into an α helix? (Hint: consult the properties of the amino acids in Figure 4-3.)

### **QUESTION 4-23 (Page 55)**
The curve shown in Figure 4-35 is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation: rate (v) = Vmax[S]/(KM + [S]). Can you convince yourself that the features qualitatively described in the text are accurately represented by this equation? In particular, how can the equation be simplified when the substrate concentration [S] is in one of the following ranges: (A) [S] is much smaller than the KM, (B) [S] equals the KM, and (C) [S] is much larger than the KM?

### **QUESTION 4-24 (Page 55)**
The rate of a simple enzyme reaction is given by the standard Michaelis-Menten equation...

Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes. Histone H4 proteins from a pea and a cow, for example, differ in only 2 of 102 amino acids. Comparison of the gene sequences shows many more differences, but only two change the amino acid sequence. These observations indicate that mutations that change amino acids must have been selected against during evolution. Why do you suppose that amino-acid-altering mutations in histone genes are deleterious?

### **QUESTION 6-5 (Page 27)**
DNA mismatch repair enzymes preferentially repair bases on the newly synthesized DNA strand, using the old DNA strand as a template. If mismatches were simply repaired without regard for which strand served as template, would this reduce replication errors as effectively? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 7-8 (Page 38)**
The Lacheinmal protein is a hypothetical protein that causes people to smile more often. It is inactive in many chronically unhappy people. The mRNA isolated from a number of different unhappy individuals in the same family was found to lack an internal stretch of 173 nucleotides that is present in the Lacheinmal mRNA isolated from happy members of the same family. The DNA sequences of the Lacheinmal genes from the happy and unhappy family members were determined and compared. They differed by a single nucleotide substitution, which lay in an intron. What can you say about the molecular basis of unhappiness in this family? (Hints: [1] Can you hypothesize a molecular mechanism by which a single nucleotide substitution in a gene could cause the observed deletion in the mRNA? Note that the deletion is internal to the mRNA. [2] Assuming the 173-base-pair deletion removes coding sequences from the Lacheinmal mRNA, how would the Lacheinmal protein differ between the happy and unhappy people?)

### **QUESTION 7-12 (Page 38)**
In an alien world, the genetic code is written in pairs of nucleotides. How many amino acids could such a code specify? In a different world, a triplet code is used, but the order of nucleotides is not important; it only matters which nucleotides are present. How many amino acids could this code specify? Would you expect to encounter any problems translating these codes?

### **QUESTION 7-13 (Page 38)**
One remarkable feature of the genetic code is that amino acids with similar chemical properties often have similar codons. Thus codons with U or C as the second nucleotide tend to specify hydrophobic amino acids. Can you suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon in terms of the early evolution of the protein-synthesis machinery?

### **QUESTION 7-14 (Page 38)**
A mutation in DNA generates a UGA stop codon in the middle of the mRNA coding for a particular protein. A second mutation in the cell's DNA leads to a single nucleotide change in a tRNA that allows the correct translation of this protein; that is, the second mutation "suppresses" the defect caused by the first. The altered tRNA translates the UGA as tryptophan. What nucleotide change has probably occurred in the mutant tRNA molecule? What consequences would the presence of such a mutant tRNA have for the translation of the normal genes in this cell?

The charging of a tRNA with an amino acid can be represented by the following equation: amino acid + tRNA + ATP → aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP + PPᵢ... The free-energy change of the charging reaction shown in the equation is close to zero and therefore would not be expected to favor attachment of the amino acid to tRNA. Can you suggest a further step that could drive the reaction to completion?

The λ repressor binds as a dimer to critical sites on the λ genome to repress the virus's lytic genes...Induction is initiated by cleavage of the repressor at a site between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, which causes the repressor to dissociate from the DNA...Given that the number (concentration) of DNA-binding domains is unchanged by cleavage of the repressor, why do you suppose its cleavage results in its dissociation from the DNA?

### **QUESTION 8-8 (Page 28)**
The Arg genes that encode the enzymes for arginine biosynthesis are located at several positions around the genome of E. coli, and they are regulated coordinately by a transcription regulator encoded by the ArgR gene...Given that ArgR is a repressor protein, would you expect that ArgR would bind more tightly or less tightly to the DNA sequences when arginine is abundant?

Differentiated cells of an organism contain the same genes...Describe an experiment that substantiates the first sentence of this question, and explain why it does.

### **QUESTION 8-11 (Page 29)**
Figure 8-17 shows a simple scheme by which three transcription regulators are used during development to create eight different cell types. How many cell types could you create, using the same rules, with four different transcription regulators? As described in the text, MyoD is a transcription regulator that by itself is sufficient to induce muscle-specific gene expression in fibroblasts. How does this observation fit the scheme in Figure 8-17?

### **QUESTION 8-12 (Page 29)**
Imagine the two situations shown in Figure Q8-12. In cell I, a transient signal induces the synthesis of protein A, which is a transcriptional activator that turns on many genes including its own. In cell II, a transient signal induces the synthesis of protein R, which is a transcriptional repressor that turns off many genes including its own. In which, if either, of these situations will the descendants of the original cell “remember” that the progenitor cell had experienced the transient signal? Explain your reasoning.

### **QUESTION 8-13 (Page 29)**
Discuss the following argument: "If the expression of every gene depends on a set of transcription regulators, then the expression of these regulators must also depend on the expression of other regulators...Cells would therefore need an infinite number of genes, most of which would code for transcription regulators." How does the cell get by without having to achieve the impossible?

## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 11–1 (Page 5)**
Water molecules are said "to reorganize into a cagelike structure” around hydrophobic compounds (e.g., see Figure 11-9).
