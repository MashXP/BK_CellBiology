## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 9–1 (Page 3)**
In this chapter, we argue that genetic variability is beneficial for a species because it enhances that species' ability to adapt to changing conditions. Why, then, do you think that cells go to such great lengths to ensure the fidelity of DNA replication?

### **QUESTION 9–2 (Page 12)**
Why do you suppose that horizontal gene transfer is more prevalent in single-celled organisms than in multicellular organisms?

### **QUESTION 9–3 (Page 13)**
Highly conserved genes such as those for ribosomal RNA are present as clearly recognizable relatives in all organisms on Earth; thus, they have evolved very slowly over time. Were such genes "born" perfect?

### **QUESTION 9–4 (Page 20)**
Many transposons move within a genome by replicative mechanisms (such as those shown in Figure 9-24B). They therefore increase in copy number each time they transpose. Although individual transposition events are rare, many transposons are found in multiple copies in genomes. What do you suppose keeps the transposons from completely overrunning their hosts' genomes?

### **QUESTION 9–5 (Page 22)**
Discuss the following statement: "Viruses exist in the twilight zone of life: outside cells they are simply dead assemblies of molecules; inside cells, however, they are alive."

### **QUESTION 9–6 (Page 25)**
Mobile genetic elements, such as the Alu sequences, are found in many copies in human DNA. In what ways could the presence of an Alu sequence affect a nearby gene?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 9-7 (Page 33)**
Discuss the following statement: "Mobile genetic elements are parasites. They are always harmful to the host organism.”

### **QUESTION 9-8 (Page 33)**
Human Chromosome 22 (48 × 10⁶ nucleotide pairs in length) has about 700 protein-coding genes, which average 19,000 nucleotide pairs in length and contain an average of 5.4 exons, each of which averages 266 nucleotide pairs. What fraction of the average protein-coding gene is converted into mRNA? What fraction of the chromosome do these genes occupy?

### **QUESTION 9-9 (Page 33)**
(True or False?) The DNA sequence of most of the human genome is unimportant. Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 9-10 (Page 33)**
Mobile genetic elements make up nearly half of the human genome and are inserted more or less randomly throughout it. However, in some spots these elements are rare, as illustrated for a cluster of genes called HoxD...Why do you suppose that mobile genetic elements are so rare in the HoxD cluster?

### **QUESTION 9-11 (Page 34)**
An early graphical method for comparing nucleotide sequences—the so-called diagon plot—still yields one of the best visual comparisons of sequence relatedness...
A. From the comparison of the human β-globin gene with the human β-globin cDNA (Figure Q9-11A), can you deduce the positions of exons and introns in the β-globin gene?
B. Are the exons of the human β-globin gene (indicated by shading in Figure Q9–11B) similar to those of the mouse β-globin gene? Identify and explain any key differences.
C. Is there any sequence similarity between the human and mouse β-globin genes that lies outside the exons? If so, identify its location and offer an explanation for its preservation during evolution.
D. Did the mouse or human gene undergo a change of intron length during their evolutionary divergence? How can you tell?

### **QUESTION 9-12 (Page 34)**
Your advisor suggests that you write a computer program that will identify the exons of protein-coding genes directly from the sequence of the human genome. In preparation for that task, you decide to write down a list of the features that might distinguish protein-coding sequences from intronic DNA and from other sequences in the genome. What features would you list?

### **QUESTION 9-13 (Page 34)**
You are interested in finding out the function of a particular gene in the mouse genome. You have determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene...but neither the gene nor the encoded protein resembles anything previously described. What types of additional information about the gene and the encoded protein would you like to know in order to narrow down its function, and why?

### **QUESTION 9-14 (Page 34)**
Why do you expect to encounter a stop codon about every 20 codons or so in a random sequence of DNA?

### **QUESTION 9-15 (Page 34)**
Which of the processes listed below contribute significantly to the evolution of new protein-coding genes?
A. Duplication of genes to create extra copies that can acquire new functions.
B. Formation of new genes de novo from noncoding DNA in the genome.
C. Horizontal transfer of DNA between cells of different species.
D. Mutation of existing genes to create new functions.
E. Shuffling of protein domains by gene rearrangement.

### **QUESTION 9-16 (Page 35)**
Some protein sequences evolve more rapidly than others...
A. Why are there such large differences between the synonymous and nonsynonymous rates of nucleotide substitution?
B. Considering that the rates of synonymous changes are about the same for all three genes, how is it possible for the histone H3 gene to resist so effectively those nucleotide changes that alter its amino acid sequence?
C. In principle, a protein might be highly conserved because its gene exists in a "privileged" site in the genome that is subject to very low mutation rates. What feature of the data in the table argues against this possibility for the histone H3 protein?

### **QUESTION 9-17 (Page 35)**
Hemoglobin-like proteins were discovered in legumes...It was hypothesized that the plant hemoglobin gene was acquired by horizontal transfer from an animal...
A. Does the evidence in the tree support or refute the hypothesis that the plant hemoglobins arose by horizontal gene transfer from animals?
B. Supposing that the plant hemoglobin genes were originally derived by horizontal transfer (from a parasitic nematode, for example), what would you expect the phylogenetic tree to look like?

### **QUESTION 9-18 (Page 35)**
The accuracy of DNA replication in the human germ-cell line is such that on average only about 0.6 out of the 6 billion nucleotides is altered at each cell division...Any two modern humans chosen at random will differ by about 1 nucleotide pair per 1000...how many cell generations must have elapsed since the days of our original ancestor parents for 1 difference per 1000 nucleotides to have accumulated in modern humans?

### **QUESTION 9-19 (Page 35)**
Reverse transcriptases do not proofread as they synthesize DNA using an RNA template. What do you think the consequences of this are for the treatment of AIDS?
