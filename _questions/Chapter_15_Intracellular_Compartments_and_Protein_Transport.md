## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 15–1 (Page 5)**
As shown in the drawings in Figure 15-3, the lipid bilayer of the inner and outer nuclear membranes forms a continuous sheet, joined around the nuclear pores. As membranes are two-dimensional fluids, this would imply that membrane proteins can diffuse freely between the two nuclear membranes. Yet each of these two nuclear membranes has a different protein composition, reflecting different functions. How could you reconcile this apparent contradiction?

### **QUESTION 15–2 (Page 10)**
Why do eukaryotic cells require a nucleus as a separate compartment when prokaryotic cells can manage perfectly well without?

### **QUESTION 15–3 (Page 15)**
Explain how an mRNA molecule can remain attached to the ER membrane while individual ribosomes translating it are released and rejoin the cytosolic pool of ribosomes after each round of translation.

### **QUESTION 15–4 (Page 16)**
A. Predict the membrane orientation of a protein that is synthesized with an uncleaved, internal signal sequence (shown as the red start-transfer sequence in Figure 15-17) but does not contain a stop-transfer sequence.
B. Similarly, predict the membrane orientation of a protein that is synthesized with an N-terminal cleaved signal sequence followed by a stop-transfer sequence, followed by a start-transfer sequence.
C. What arrangement of signal sequences would enable the insertion of a multipass protein with an odd number of transmembrane segments?

### **QUESTION 15–5 (Page 21)**
The budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from eukaryotic plasma membrane fragments can be observed when adaptins, clathrin, and dynamin-GTP are added to the membrane preparation. What would you observe if you omitted (A) adaptins, (B) clathrin, or (C) dynamin? (D) What would you observe if the plasma membrane fragments were from a prokaryotic cell?

### **QUESTION 15–6 (Page 22)**
Why might it be advantageous to add a preassembled block of 14 sugar residues to a protein in the ER, rather than building the sugar chains step-by-step on the surface of the protein by the sequential addition of sugars by individual enzymes?

### **QUESTION 15–7 (Page 28)**
What would you expect to happen in cells that secrete large amounts of protein through the regulated secretory pathway if the ionic conditions in the ER lumen could be changed to resemble those in the lumen of the trans Golgi network?

### **QUESTION 15–8 (Page 32)**
Iron (Fe) is an essential trace metal that is needed by all cells...From these properties, describe how iron is taken up, and discuss the advantages of this elaborate scheme.

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 15-9 (Page 36)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Ribosomes are cytoplasmic structures that, during protein synthesis, become linked by an mRNA molecule to form polyribosomes.
B. The amino acid sequence Leu-His-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ala-Gln-Ser-Lys-Leu-Ser-Ser is a signal sequence that directs proteins to the ER.
C. All transport vesicles in the cell must have a v-SNARE protein in their membrane.
D. Transport vesicles deliver proteins and lipids to the cell surface.
E. If the delivery of prospective lysosomal proteins from the trans Golgi network to the late endosomes were blocked, lysosomal proteins would be secreted by the constitutive secretion pathways shown in Figure 15-30.
F. Lysosomes digest only substances that have been taken up by cells by endocytosis.
G. N-linked sugar chains are found on glycoproteins that face the cell surface, as well as on glycoproteins that face the lumen of the ER, trans Golgi network, and mitochondria.
H. Ribosomes bound to the outer nuclear membrane make proteins that are translocated co-translationally into the membrane.

### **QUESTION 15-10 (Page 36)**
Some proteins shuttle back and forth between the nucleus and the cytosol. They need a nuclear export signal to get out of the nucleus. How do you suppose they get into the nucleus?

### **QUESTION 15-11 (Page 36)**
Influenza viruses enter the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis...Sketch a diagram showing the pathway (in detail) by which flu virus enters cells, and speculate how NH₃ may protect cells from virus infection.

### **QUESTION 15-12 (Page 36)**
Consider the v-SNAREs that direct transport vesicles from the trans Golgi network to the plasma membrane. They, like all other v-SNAREs, are membrane proteins that are integrated into the membrane of the ER during their biosynthesis and are then carried by transport vesicles to their destination. Thus, transport vesicles budding from the ER contain at least two kinds of v-SNAREs—those that target the vesicles to the cis Golgi cisternae, and those that are in transit to the trans Golgi network... (A) Why might this be a problem? (B) Suggest possible ways in which the cell might solve it.

### **QUESTION 15-13 (Page 37)**
A particular type of Drosophila mutant becomes paralyzed when the temperature is raised. The mutation affects the structure of dynamin, causing it to be inactivated at the higher temperature...Suggest why signal transmission at a synapse might require dynamin.

### **QUESTION 15-14 (Page 37)**
Edit each of the following statements, if required, to make them true: "Because nuclear localization sequences are not cleaved off...they can be reused...This is in contrast to ER signal sequences, which are cleaved off...ER signal sequences cannot therefore be reused..."

### **QUESTION 15-15 (Page 37)**
Consider a protein that contains an ER signal sequence at its N-terminus and a nuclear localization sequence in its middle. What do you think the fate of this protein would be? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 15-16 (Page 37)**
Compare and contrast protein import into the ER and into the nucleus. List at least two major differences in the mechanisms, and speculate why the ER mechanism might not work for nuclear import and vice versa.

### **QUESTION 15-17 (Page 37)**
During mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down and intranuclear proteins completely intermix with cytosolic proteins. Is this consistent with the evolutionary scheme proposed in Figure 15-3? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 15-18 (Page 37)**
A protein that inhibits certain proteolytic enzymes is normally secreted into the bloodstream by liver cells. This inhibitor protein, antitrypsin, is absent from the bloodstream of patients who carry a mutation that results in a single amino acid change in the protein...Why, then, does the mutation cause the disease? Think of more than one possibility and suggest ways in which you could distinguish between them.

### **QUESTION 15-19 (Page 37)**
Dr. Outonalimb's claim to fame is her discovery of forgettin, a protein...Her hypothesis is that forgettin has a hydrophobic ER signal sequence at its C-terminus...Critique her proposal...

### **QUESTION 15-20 (Page 37)**
Taking the evolutionary scheme in Figure 15-3 one step further, suggest how the Golgi apparatus could have evolved. Sketch a simple diagram to illustrate your ideas. For the Golgi apparatus to be functional, what else would be needed?

### **QUESTION 15-21 (Page 37)**
If membrane proteins are integrated into the ER membrane by means of the ER protein translocator (which is itself composed of membrane proteins), how do the first protein translocation channels become incorporated into the ER membrane?

### **QUESTION 15-22 (Page 37)**
The sketch in Figure Q15-22 is a schematic drawing of the electron micrograph shown in the third panel of Figure 15-20A. Name the structures that are labeled in the sketch.

### **QUESTION 15-23 (Page 37)**
What would happen to proteins bound for the nucleus if there were insufficient energy to transport them?
