## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 5–1 (Page 4)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. A DNA strand has a polarity because its two ends contain different bases.
B. G-C base pairs are more stable than A-T base pairs.

### **QUESTION 5–2 (Page 15)**
Assuming that the histone octamer (shown in Figure 5-20) forms a cylinder 9 nm in diameter and 5 nm in height and that the human genome forms 32 million nucleosomes, what volume of the nucleus (6 µm in diameter) is occupied by histone octamers? (Volume of a cylinder is πr²h; volume of a sphere is 4/3 πr³.) What fraction of the total volume of the nucleus do the histone octamers occupy? How does this compare with the volume of the nucleus occupied by human DNA?

### **QUESTION 5–3 (Page 17)**
Histone proteins are among the most highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes. Histone H4 proteins from a pea and a cow, for example, differ in only 2 of 102 amino acids. Comparison of the gene sequences shows many more differences, but only two change the amino acid sequence. These observations indicate that mutations that change amino acids must have been selected against during evolution. Why do you suppose that amino-acid-altering mutations in histone genes are deleterious?

### **QUESTION 5–4 (Page 20)**
Mutations in a particular gene on the X chromosome result in color blindness in men. By contrast, most women carrying the mutation have proper color vision but see colored objects with reduced resolution, as though functional cone cells (the photoreceptor cells responsible for color vision) are spaced farther apart than normal in the retina. Can you give a plausible explanation for this observation? If a woman is color-blind, what could you say about her father? About her mother? Explain your answers.

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 5-5 (Page 24)**
A. The nucleotide sequence of one DNA strand of a DNA double helix is 5'-GGATTTTTGTCCACAATCA-3'. What is the sequence of the complementary strand?
B. In the DNA of certain bacterial cells, 13% of the nucleotides contain adenine. What are the percentages of the other nucleotides?
C. How many possible nucleotide sequences are there for a stretch of single-stranded DNA that is N nucleotides long?
D. Suppose you had a method of cutting DNA at specific sequences of nucleotides. How many nucleotides long (on average) would such a sequence have to be in order to make just one cut in a bacterial genome of 3 × 10⁶ nucleotide pairs? How would the answer differ for the genome of an animal cell that contains 3 × 10⁹ nucleotide pairs?

### **QUESTION 5-6 (Page 24)**
An A-T base pair is stabilized by only two hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen-bonding schemes of very similar strengths can also be drawn between other base combinations that normally do not occur in DNA molecules, such as the A-C and the A-G pairs shown in Figure Q5-6. What would happen if these pairs formed during DNA replication and the inappropriate bases were incorporated? Discuss why this does not often happen. (Hint: see Figure 5-4.)

### **QUESTION 5-7 (Page 24)**
A. A macromolecule isolated from an extraterrestrial source superficially resembles DNA, but closer analysis reveals that the bases have quite different structures (Figure Q5-7). Bases V, W, X, and Y have replaced bases A, T, G, and C. Look at these structures closely. Could these DNA-like molecules have been derived from a living organism that uses principles of genetic inheritance similar to those used by organisms on Earth?
B. Simply judged by their potential for hydrogen-bonding, could any of these extraterrestrial bases replace terrestrial A, T, G, or C in terrestrial DNA? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 5-8 (Page 24)**
The two strands of a DNA double helix can be separated by heating. If you raised the temperature of a solution containing the following three DNA molecules, in what order do you suppose they would “melt”? Explain your answer.
A. 5'-GCGGGCCAGCCCGAGTGGGTAGCCCAGG-3'
   3'-CGCCCGGTCGGGCTCACCCATCGGGTCC-5'
B. 5'-ATTATAAAATATTTAGATACTATATTTACAA-3'
   3'-TAATATTTTATAAATCTATGATATAAATGTT-5'
C. 5'-AGAGCTAGATCGAT-3'
   3'-TCTCGATCTAGCTA-5'

### **QUESTION 5-9 (Page 24)**
The total length of DNA in one copy of the human genome is about 1 m, and the diameter of the double helix is about 2 nm. Nucleotides in a DNA double helix are stacked at an interval of 0.34 nm. If the DNA were enlarged so that its diameter equaled that of an electrical extension cord (5 mm), how long would the extension cord be from one end to the other (assuming that it is completely stretched out)? How close would the bases be to each other? How long would a gene of 1000 nucleotide pairs be?

### **QUESTION 5-10 (Page 25)**
A compact disc (CD) stores about 4.8 × 10⁹ bits of information in a 96 cm² area. This information is stored as a binary code—that is, every bit is either a 0 or a 1.
A. How many bits would it take to specify each nucleotide pair in a DNA sequence?
B. How many CDs would it take to store the information contained in the human genome?

### **QUESTION 5-11 (Page 25)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Each eukaryotic chromosome must contain the following DNA sequence elements: multiple origins of replication, two telomeres, and one centromere.
B. Nucleosome core particles are 30 nm in diameter.

### **QUESTION 5-12 (Page 25)**
Define the following terms and their relationships to one another:
A. Interphase chromosome
B. Mitotic chromosome
C. Chromatin
D. Heterochromatin
E. Histones
F. Nucleosome

### **QUESTION 5-13 (Page 25)**
Carefully consider the result shown in Figure Q5-13. Each of the two colonies shown on the left is a clump of approximately 100,000 yeast cells that has grown up from a single cell... When it is positioned near the telomere, which is highly condensed, Ade2 is no longer expressed. How do you think the white sectors arise? What can you conclude about the propagation of the transcriptional state of the Ade2 gene from mother to daughter cells?

### **QUESTION 5-14 (Page 25)**
The two electron micrographs in Figure Q5-14 show nuclei of two different cell types. Can you tell from these pictures which of the two cells is transcribing more of its genes? Explain how you arrived at your answer.

### **QUESTION 5-15 (Page 25)**
DNA forms a right-handed helix. Pick out the right-handed helix from those shown in Figure Q5-15.

### **QUESTION 5-16 (Page 26)**
A single nucleosome core particle is 11 nm in diameter and contains 147 base pairs (bp) of DNA (the DNA double helix measures 0.34 nm/bp). What packing ratio (ratio of DNA length to nucleosome diameter) has been achieved by wrapping DNA around the histone octamer? Assuming that there are an additional 54 bp of extended DNA in the linker between nucleosomes, how condensed is “beads-on-a-string” DNA relative to fully extended DNA? What fraction of the 10,000-fold condensation that occurs at mitosis does this first level of packing represent?
