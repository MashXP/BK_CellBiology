## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 12–1 (Page 8)**
A simple enzyme reaction can be described by the equation E + S ↔ ES → E + P...
A. Write a corresponding equation describing the workings of a transporter (T) that mediates the transport of a solute (S) down its concentration gradient.
B. What does this equation tell you about the function of a transporter?
C. Why would this equation be an inappropriate choice to represent the function of a channel?

### **QUESTION 12–2 (Page 14)**
A rise in the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration causes muscle cells to contract...Ouabain and digitalis are used for treating patients with heart disease because they make heart muscle cells contract more strongly. Both drugs function by partially inhibiting the Na⁺ pump in the plasma membrane of these cells. Can you propose an explanation for the effects of the drugs in the patients? What will happen if too much of either drug is taken?

### **QUESTION 12–3 (Page 22)**
The figure above shows a recording from a patch-clamp experiment...The membrane patch...contains molecules of the acetylcholine receptor, which is a ligand-gated cation channel...
(A) Describe what you can learn about the channels from this recording.
(B) How would the recording differ if acetylcholine were (i) omitted or (ii) added to the solution outside the microelectrode only?

### **QUESTION 12–4 (Page 23)**
Using the Nernst equation and the ion concentrations given in Table 12-1 (p. 391), calculate the equilibrium membrane potential of K⁺ and Na⁺...What membrane potential would you predict in a resting animal cell? Explain your answer. What would happen if a large number of Na⁺ channels suddenly opened...? What would you predict would happen next if the Na⁺ channels closed again?

### **QUESTION 12–5 (Page 27)**
Explain as precisely as you can, but in no more than 100 words, the ionic basis of an action potential and how it is passed along an axon.

### **QUESTION 12–6 (Page 30)**
In the disease myasthenia gravis, the human body makes—by mistake—antibodies to its own acetylcholine receptor molecules...The disease leads to a devastating progressive weakening of the muscles...Explain which step of muscle function is affected.

### **QUESTION 12–7 (Page 31)**
When an inhibitory neurotransmitter such as GABA opens Cl⁻ channels in the plasma membrane of a postsynaptic neuron, why does this make it harder for an excitatory neurotransmitter to excite the neuron?

### **QUESTION 12-8 (Page 36)**
The diagram in Figure 12–9 shows a transporter that mediates the passive transfer of a solute down its concentration gradient...How would you need to change the diagram to convert the transporter into a pump that moves the solute up its concentration gradient by hydrolyzing ATP?

### **QUESTION 12-9 (Page 36)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. The plasma membrane is highly impermeable to all charged molecules.
B. Channels have specific binding pockets for the solute molecules they allow to pass.
C. Transporters allow solutes to cross a membrane at much faster rates than do channels.
D. Certain H⁺ pumps are fueled by light energy.
E. The plasma membrane of many animal cells contains open K⁺ channels, yet the K⁺ concentration in the cytosol is much higher than outside the cell.
F. A symport would function as an antiport if its orientation in the membrane were reversed.
G. The membrane potential of an axon temporarily becomes more negative when an action potential excites it.

### **QUESTION 12-10 (Page 36)**
List the following compounds in order of decreasing lipid-bilayer permeability: RNA, Ca²⁺, glucose, ethanol, N₂, water.

### **QUESTION 12-11 (Page 36)**
Name at least one similarity and at least one difference between the following:
A. Symport and antiport
B. Active transport and passive transport
C. Membrane potential and electrochemical gradient
D. Pump and transporter
E. Axon and telephone wire
F. Solute and ion

### **QUESTION 12-12 (Page 36)**
Discuss the following statement: "The differences between a channel and a transporter are like the differences between a bridge and a ferry."

### **QUESTION 12-13 (Page 36)**
The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is made in the cytosol and then transported into synaptic vesicles, where its concentration is more than 100-fold higher than in the cytosol...Suggest a mechanism that is consistent with all of these observations.

### **QUESTION 12-14 (Page 36)**
The resting membrane potential of a typical animal cell is about –70 mV, and the thickness of a lipid bilayer is about 4.5 nm. What is the strength of the electric field across the membrane in V/cm? What do you suppose would happen if you applied this field strength to two metal electrodes separated by a 1-cm air gap?

### **QUESTION 12-15 (Page 36)**
Assume you have constructed lipid vesicles that contain Na⁺ pumps as the sole membrane protein...determine what would happen in each of the following cases.
A. Your vesicles were suspended in a solution containing both Na⁺ and K⁺ ions and had a solution with the same ionic composition inside them.
B. You add ATP to the suspension described in (A).
C. You add ATP, but the solution...contains only Na⁺ ions and no K⁺ ions.
D. ...half of the pump molecules embedded in the membrane of each vesicle were oriented the other way around...You then add ATP...
E. You add ATP...but in addition to Na⁺ pumps, the membrane of your vesicles also contains K⁺ leak channels.

### **QUESTION 12-16 (Page 36)**
Name the three ways in which an ion channel can be gated.

### **QUESTION 12-17 (Page 36)**
One thousand Ca²⁺ channels open in the plasma membrane of a cell that is 1000 µm³ in size and has a cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration of 100 nM. For how long would the channels need to stay open in order for the cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration to rise to 5 µM?

### **QUESTION 12-18 (Page 37)**
Amino acids are taken up by animal cells using a symport in the plasma membrane. What is the most likely ion whose electrochemical gradient drives the import? Is ATP consumed in the process? If so, how?

### **QUESTION 12-19 (Page 37)**
...endosomes...need an acidic lumen in order to function. Acidification is achieved by an H⁺ pump in the endosomal membrane, which also contains Cl⁻ channels...
A. Can you explain how Cl⁻ channels might help acidification?
B. According to your explanation, would the Cl⁻ channels be absolutely required to lower the pH inside the endosome?

### **QUESTION 12-20 (Page 37)**
Some bacterial cells can grow on either ethanol or acetate as their only carbon source. Dr. Schwips measured the rate at which the two compounds traverse the bacterial plasma membrane but...failed to label his data accurately.
A. Plot the data from the table below.
B. Determine from your graph whether the data describing compound A correspond to the uptake of ethanol or acetate.

### **QUESTION 12-21 (Page 37)**
Acetylcholine-gated cation channels do not discriminate between Na⁺, K⁺, and Ca²⁺ ions, allowing all to pass through them freely. So why is it that when acetylcholine binds to this protein in the plasma membrane of muscle cells, the channel opens and there is a large net influx of primarily Na⁺ ions?

### **QUESTION 12-22 (Page 37)**
The ion channels that are regulated by binding of neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, or glycine, have a similar overall structure. Yet each class of these channels consists of a very diverse set of subtypes...Do you suppose that such extreme diversity is a good or a bad thing from the standpoint of the pharmaceutical industry?
