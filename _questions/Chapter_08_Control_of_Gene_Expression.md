## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 8–1 (Page 7)**
Bacterial cells can take up the amino acid tryptophan (Trp) from their surroundings or, if there is an insufficient external supply, they can synthesize tryptophan from other small molecules. The Trp repressor is a transcription regulator that shuts off the transcription of genes that code for the enzymes required for the synthesis of tryptophan (see Figure 8-7).
A. What would happen to the regulation of the tryptophan operon in cells that express a mutant form of the tryptophan repressor that (1) cannot bind to DNA, (2) cannot bind tryptophan, or (3) binds to DNA even in the absence of tryptophan?
B. What would happen in scenarios (1), (2), and (3) if the cells, in addition, produced normal tryptophan repressor protein from a second, normal gene?

### **QUESTION 8–2 (Page 10)**
Explain how DNA-binding proteins can make sequence-specific contacts to a double-stranded DNA molecule without breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold the bases together. Indicate how, through such contacts, a protein can distinguish a T-A from a C-G pair. Indicate the parts of the nucleotide base pairs that could form noncovalent interactions—hydrogen bonds, electrostatic attractions, or hydrophobic interactions (see Panel 2-3, pp. 70–71)—with a DNA-binding protein. The structures of all the base pairs in DNA are given in Figure 5-4.

### **QUESTION 8–3 (Page 11)**
Some transcription regulators bind to DNA and cause the double helix to bend at a sharp angle. Such "bending proteins" can stimulate the initiation of transcription without contacting either the RNA polymerase, any of the general transcription factors, or any other transcription regulators. Can you devise a plausible explanation for how these proteins might work to modulate transcription? Draw a diagram that illustrates your explanation.

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 8-4 (Page 27)**
A virus that grows in bacteria...can replicate in one of two ways. In the prophage state, the viral DNA is inserted into the bacterial chromosome...In the lytic state, the viral DNA is released...These two forms of growth are controlled by two transcription regulators, the repressor (product of the cI gene) and Cro...When bacteria containing a phage in the prophage state are briefly irradiated with UV light, cI protein is degraded.
A. What will happen next?
B. Will the change in (A) be reversed when the UV light is switched off?
C. What advantage might this response to UV light provide to the virus?

### **QUESTION 8-5 (Page 28)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. In bacteria, but not in eukaryotes, many mRNAs contain the coding region for more than one gene.
B. Most DNA-binding proteins bind to the major groove of the DNA double helix.
C. Of the major control points in gene expression (transcription, RNA processing, RNA transport, translation, and control of a protein's activity), transcription initiation is one of the most common.

### **QUESTION 8-6 (Page 28)**
Your task in the laboratory of Professor Quasimodo is to determine how far an enhancer (a binding site for an activator protein) can be moved from the promoter of the straightspine gene and still activate transcription. You systematically vary the number of nucleotide pairs between these two sites and then determine the amount of transcription...At first glance, your data look confusing (Figure Q8-6). What would you have expected for the results of this experiment? Can you save your reputation and explain these results to Professor Quasimodo?

### **QUESTION 8-7 (Page 28)**
The λ repressor binds as a dimer to critical sites on the λ genome to repress the virus's lytic genes...Induction is initiated by cleavage of the repressor at a site between the DNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain, which causes the repressor to dissociate from the DNA...Given that the number (concentration) of DNA-binding domains is unchanged by cleavage of the repressor, why do you suppose its cleavage results in its dissociation from the DNA?

### **QUESTION 8-8 (Page 28)**
The Arg genes that encode the enzymes for arginine biosynthesis are located at several positions around the genome of E. coli, and they are regulated coordinately by a transcription regulator encoded by the ArgR gene...Given that ArgR is a repressor protein, would you expect that ArgR would bind more tightly or less tightly to the DNA sequences when arginine is abundant? If ArgR functioned instead as an activator protein, would you expect the binding of arginine to increase or to decrease its affinity for its regulatory DNA sequences? Explain your answers.

### **QUESTION 8-9 (Page 28)**
When enhancers were initially found to influence transcription from many thousands of nucleotide pairs away from the promoters they control, two principal models were invoked...In the “DNA looping” model, direct interactions between proteins bound at enhancers and promoters were proposed...In the “scanning”...model, RNA polymerase...was proposed to bind at the enhancer and then scan along the DNA until it reached the promoter...Does this experiment distinguish between the DNA looping model and the scanning model? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 8-10 (Page 28)**
Differentiated cells of an organism contain the same genes...Describe an experiment that substantiates the first sentence of this question, and explain why it does.

### **QUESTION 8-11 (Page 29)**
Figure 8-17 shows a simple scheme by which three transcription regulators are used during development to create eight different cell types. How many cell types could you create, using the same rules, with four different transcription regulators? As described in the text, MyoD is a transcription regulator that by itself is sufficient to induce muscle-specific gene expression in fibroblasts. How does this observation fit the scheme in Figure 8-17?

### **QUESTION 8-12 (Page 29)**
Imagine the two situations shown in Figure Q8-12. In cell I, a transient signal induces the synthesis of protein A, which is a transcriptional activator that turns on many genes including its own. In cell II, a transient signal induces the synthesis of protein R, which is a transcriptional repressor that turns off many genes including its own. In which, if either, of these situations will the descendants of the original cell “remember” that the progenitor cell had experienced the transient signal? Explain your reasoning.

### **QUESTION 8-13 (Page 29)**
Discuss the following argument: "If the expression of every gene depends on a set of transcription regulators, then the expression of these regulators must also depend on the expression of other regulators...Cells would therefore need an infinite number of genes, most of which would code for transcription regulators." How does the cell get by without having to achieve the impossible?
