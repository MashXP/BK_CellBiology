## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 2–1 (Page 4)**
A cup containing exactly 18 g, or 1 mole, of water was emptied into the Aegean Sea 3000 years ago. What are the chances that the same quantity of water, scooped today from the Pacific Ocean, would include at least one of these ancient water molecules? Assume perfect mixing and an approximate volume for the world's oceans of 1.5 billion cubic kilometers (1.5 × 10⁹ km³).

### **QUESTION 2–2 (Page 5)**
A carbon atom contains six protons and six neutrons.
A. What are its atomic number and atomic weight?
B. How many electrons does it have?
C. How many additional electrons must it add to fill its outermost shell? How does this affect carbon's chemical behavior?
D. Carbon with an atomic weight of 14 is radioactive. How does it differ in structure from nonradioactive carbon? How does this difference affect its chemical behavior?

### **QUESTION 2-3 (Page 8)**
Discuss whether the following statement is correct: "An ionic bond can, in principle, be thought of as a very polar covalent bond. Polar covalent bonds, then, fall somewhere between ionic bonds at one end of the spectrum and nonpolar covalent bonds at the other end."

### **QUESTION 2–4 (Page 9)**
True or false? "When NaCl is dissolved in water, the water molecules closest to the ions will tend to preferentially orient themselves so that their oxygen atoms face the sodium ions and face away from the chloride ions." Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 2–5 (Page 12)**
A. Are there H₃O⁺ ions present in pure water at neutral pH (i.e., at pH = 7.0)? If so, how are they formed?
B. If they exist, what is the ratio of H₃O⁺ ions to H₂O molecules at neutral pH? (Hint: the molecular weight of water is 18, and 1 liter of water weighs 1 kg.)

### **QUESTION 2–6 (Page 18)**
Why do you suppose only L-amino acids and not a random mixture of the L- and D-forms of each amino acid are used to make proteins?

### **QUESTION 2-7 (Page 21)**
What is meant by “polarity” of a polypeptide chain and by “polarity” of a chemical bond? How do the meanings differ?

### **QUESTION 2–8 (Page 24)**
In principle, there are many different, chemically diverse ways in which small molecules can be joined together to form polymers. For example, the small molecule ethene (CH₂=CH₂) is used commercially to make the plastic polyethylene (...-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-...). The individual subunits of the three major classes of biological macromolecules, however, are all linked by similar reaction mechanisms—that is, by condensation reactions that eliminate water. Can you think of any benefits that this chemistry offers and why it might have been selected in evolution over a linking chemistry such as that used to produce polyethylene?

### **QUESTION 2-9 (Page 25)**
Why could covalent bonds not be used in place of noncovalent bonds to mediate most of the interactions of macromolecules?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 2-10 (Page 27)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. An atomic nucleus contains protons and neutrons.
B. An atom has more electrons than protons.
C. The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane.
D. All atoms of the same element have the same number of neutrons.
E. The number of neutrons determines whether the nucleus of an atom is stable or radioactive.
F. Both fatty acids and polysaccharides can be important energy stores in the cell.
G. Hydrogen bonds are weak and can be broken by thermal energy, yet they contribute significantly to the specificity of interactions between macromolecules.

### **QUESTION 2-11 (Page 27)**
To gain a better feeling for atomic dimensions, assume that the page on which this question is printed is made entirely of the polysaccharide cellulose, whose molecules are described by the formula (CₙH₂ₙOₙ), where n can be a quite large number and is variable from one molecule to another. The atomic weights of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are 12, 1, and 16, respectively, and this page weighs 5 g.
A. How many carbon atoms are there in this page?
B. In cellulose, how many carbon atoms would be stacked on top of each other to span the thickness of this page (the size of the page is 21.2 cm × 27.6 cm, and it is 0.07 mm thick)?
C. Now consider the problem from a different angle. Assume that the page is composed only of carbon atoms. A carbon atom has a diameter of 2 × 10⁻¹⁰ m (0.2 nm); how many carbon atoms of 0.2 nm diameter would it take to span the thickness of the page?
D. Compare your answers from parts B and C and explain any differences.

### **QUESTION 2-12 (Page 27)**
A. How many electrons can be accommodated in the first, second, and third electron shells of an atom?
B. How many electrons would atoms of the elements listed below have to gain or lose to obtain a completely filled outer shell? (helium, oxygen, carbon, sodium, chlorine)
C. What do the answers tell you about the reactivity of helium and the bonds that can form between sodium and chlorine?

### **QUESTION 2-13 (Page 27)**
The elements oxygen and sulfur have similar chemical properties because they both have six electrons in their outermost electron shells. Indeed, both elements form molecules with two hydrogen atoms, water (H₂O) and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). Surprisingly, at room temperature, water is a liquid, yet H₂S is a gas, despite sulfur being much larger and heavier than oxygen. Explain why this might be the case.

### **QUESTION 2-14 (Page 27)**
Write the chemical formula for a condensation reaction of two amino acids to form a peptide bond. Write the formula for its hydrolysis.

### **QUESTION 2-15 (Page 42)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Proteins are so remarkably diverse because each is made from a unique mixture of amino acids that are linked in random order.
B. Lipid bilayers are macromolecules that are made up mostly of phospholipid subunits.
C. Nucleic acids contain sugar groups.
D. Many amino acids have hydrophobic side chains.
E. The hydrophobic tails of phospholipid molecules are repelled from water.
F. DNA contains the four different bases A, G, U, and C.

### **QUESTION 2-16 (Page 42)**
A. How many different molecules composed of (a) two, (b) three, and (c) four amino acids, linked together by peptide bonds, can be made from the set of 20 naturally occurring amino acids?
B. Assume you were given a mixture consisting of one molecule each of all possible sequences of a smallish protein of molecular mass 4800 daltons. If the average molecular mass of an amino acid is, say, 120 daltons, how much would the sample weigh? How big a container would you need to hold it?
C. What does this calculation tell you about the fraction of possible proteins that are currently in use by living organisms (the average molecular mass of proteins is about 30,000 daltons)?

### **QUESTION 2-17 (Page 42)**
This is a biology textbook. Explain why the chemical principles that are described in this chapter are important in the context of modern cell biology.

### **QUESTION 2-18 (Page 42)**
A. Describe the similarities and differences between van der Waals attractions and hydrogen bonds.
B. Which of the two bonds would form (a) between two hydrogens bound to carbon atoms, (b) between a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen bound to a carbon atom, and (c) between a nitrogen atom and a hydrogen bound to an oxygen atom?

### **QUESTION 2-19 (Page 42)**
What are the forces that determine the folding of a macromolecule into a unique shape?

### **QUESTION 2-20 (Page 42)**
Fatty acids are said to be “amphipathic.” What is meant by this term, and how does an amphipathic molecule behave in water? Draw a diagram to illustrate your answer.

### **QUESTION 2-21 (Page 42)**
Are the formulas in Figure Q2-21 correct or incorrect? Explain your answer in each case.
