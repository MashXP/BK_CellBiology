## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 7–1 (Page 2)**
Consider the expression "central dogma," which refers to the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA to protein. Is the word "dogma" appropriate in this context?

### **QUESTION 7–2 (Page 5)**
In the electron micrograph in Figure 7-8, are the RNA polymerase molecules moving from right to left or from left to right? Why are the RNA transcripts so much shorter than the DNA segments (genes) that encode them?

### **QUESTION 7–3 (Page 9)**
Could the RNA polymerase used for transcription also be used to make the RNA primers required for DNA replication (discussed in Chapter 6)?

### **QUESTION 7–4 (Page 24)**
In a clever experiment performed in 1962, a cysteine already attached to its tRNA was chemically converted to an alanine. These "hybrid" tRNA molecules were then added to a cell-free translation system from which the normal cysteine-tRNAs had been removed. When the resulting protein was analyzed, it was found that alanine had been inserted at every point in the polypeptide chain where cysteine was supposed to be. Discuss what this experiment tells you about the role of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and ribosomes during the normal translation of the genetic code.

### **QUESTION 7–5 (Page 28)**
A sequence of nucleotides in a DNA strand—5'-TTAACGGCTTTTTTC-3'—was used as a template to synthesize an mRNA that was then translated into protein. Predict the C-terminal amino acid and the N-terminal amino acid of the resulting polypeptide. Assume that the mRNA is translated without the need for a start codon.

### **QUESTION 7–6 (Page 36)**
Discuss the following: "During the evolution of life on Earth, RNA lost its glorious position as the first self-replicating catalyst. Its role now is as a mere messenger in the information flow from DNA to protein.”

### **QUESTION 7-7 (Page 38)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. An individual ribosome can make only one type of protein.
B. All mRNAs fold into particular three-dimensional structures that are required for their translation.
C. The large and small subunits of an individual ribosome always stay together and never exchange partners.
D. Ribosomes are cytoplasmic organelles that are encapsulated by a single membrane.
E. Because the two strands of DNA are complementary, the mRNA of a given gene can be synthesized using either strand as a template.
F. An mRNA may contain the sequence ATTGACCCCGGTCAA.
G. The amount of a protein present in a cell depends on its rate of synthesis, its catalytic activity, and its rate of degradation.

### **QUESTION 7-8 (Page 38)**
The Lacheinmal protein is a hypothetical protein that causes people to smile more often. It is inactive in many chronically unhappy people. The mRNA isolated from a number of different unhappy individuals in the same family was found to lack an internal stretch of 173 nucleotides that is present in the Lacheinmal mRNA isolated from happy members of the same family. The DNA sequences of the Lacheinmal genes from the happy and unhappy family members were determined and compared. They differed by a single nucleotide substitution, which lay in an intron. What can you say about the molecular basis of unhappiness in this family? (Hints: [1] Can you hypothesize a molecular mechanism by which a single nucleotide substitution in a gene could cause the observed deletion in the mRNA? Note that the deletion is internal to the mRNA. [2] Assuming the 173-base-pair deletion removes coding sequences from the Lacheinmal mRNA, how would the Lacheinmal protein differ between the happy and unhappy people?)

### **QUESTION 7-9 (Page 38)**
Use the genetic code shown in Figure 7–27 to identify which of the following nucleotide sequences would code for the polypeptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartate:
1. 5'-AGA-GGA-GAU-3'
2. 5'-ACA-CCC-ACU-3'
3. 5'-GGG-AAA-UUU-3'
4. 5'-CGG-GGU-GAC-3'

### **QUESTION 7-10 (Page 38)**
"The bonds that form between the anticodon of a tRNA molecule and the three nucleotides of a codon in mRNA are ___ ." Complete this sentence with each of the following options and explain whether each of the resulting statements is correct or incorrect.
A. covalent bonds formed by GTP hydrolysis
B. hydrogen bonds that form when the tRNA is at the A site
C. broken by the translocation of the ribosome along the mRNA

### **QUESTION 7-11 (Page 38)**
List the ordinary, dictionary definitions of the terms replication, transcription, and translation. By their side, list the special meaning each term has when applied to the living cell.

### **QUESTION 7-12 (Page 38)**
In an alien world, the genetic code is written in pairs of nucleotides. How many amino acids could such a code specify? In a different world, a triplet code is used, but the order of nucleotides is not important; it only matters which nucleotides are present. How many amino acids could this code specify? Would you expect to encounter any problems translating these codes?

### **QUESTION 7-13 (Page 38)**
One remarkable feature of the genetic code is that amino acids with similar chemical properties often have similar codons. Thus codons with U or C as the second nucleotide tend to specify hydrophobic amino acids. Can you suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon in terms of the early evolution of the protein-synthesis machinery?

### **QUESTION 7-14 (Page 38)**
A mutation in DNA generates a UGA stop codon in the middle of the mRNA coding for a particular protein. A second mutation in the cell's DNA leads to a single nucleotide change in a tRNA that allows the correct translation of this protein; that is, the second mutation "suppresses" the defect caused by the first. The altered tRNA translates the UGA as tryptophan. What nucleotide change has probably occurred in the mutant tRNA molecule? What consequences would the presence of such a mutant tRNA have for the translation of the normal genes in this cell?

### **QUESTION 7-15 (Page 38)**
The charging of a tRNA with an amino acid can be represented by the following equation: amino acid + tRNA + ATP → aminoacyl-tRNA + AMP + PPᵢ... The free-energy change of the charging reaction shown in the equation is close to zero and therefore would not be expected to favor attachment of the amino acid to tRNA. Can you suggest a further step that could drive the reaction to completion?

### **QUESTION 7-16 (Page 39)**
A. The average molecular weight of a protein in the cell is about 30,000 daltons...The largest known polypeptide chain made by any cell is a protein called titin...and it has a molecular weight of 3,000,000 daltons. Estimate how long it will take a muscle cell to translate an mRNA coding for titin (assume the average molecular weight of an amino acid to be 120, and a translation rate of two amino acids per second for eukaryotic cells).
B. Protein synthesis is very accurate: for every 10,000 amino acids joined together, only one mistake is made. What is the fraction of average-sized protein molecules and of titin molecules that are synthesized without any errors?
C. The combined molecular weight of the eukaryotic ribosomal proteins is about 2.5 × 10⁶ daltons. Would it be advantageous to synthesize them as a single protein?
D. Transcription occurs at a rate of about 30 nucleotides per second. Is it possible to calculate the time required to synthesize a titin mRNA from the information given here?

### **QUESTION 7-17 (Page 39)**
Which of the following types of mutations would be predicted to harm an organism? Explain your answers.
A. Insertion of a single nucleotide near the end of the coding sequence.
B. Removal of a single nucleotide near the beginning of the coding sequence.
C. Deletion of three consecutive nucleotides in the middle of the coding sequence.
D. Deletion of four consecutive nucleotides in the middle of the coding sequence.
E. Substitution of one nucleotide for another in the middle of the coding sequence.

### **QUESTION 7-18 (Page 39)**
Figure 7-8 shows many molecules of RNA polymerase simultaneously transcribing two adjacent genes on a single DNA molecule. Looking at this figure, label the 5' and 3' ends of the DNA template strand and the sets of RNA molecules being transcribed.
