## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 10–1 (Page 2)**
DNA sequencing of your own two β-globin genes (one from each of your two Chromosome 11s) reveals a mutation in one of the genes. Given this information alone, should you worry about being a carrier of an inherited disease that could be passed on to your children? What other information would you like to have to assess your risk?

### **QUESTION 10–2 (Page 4)**
Which products result when the double-stranded DNA molecule below is digested with (A) EcoRI, (B) HaeIII, (C) HindIII, or (D) all three of these enzymes together? (See Figure 10-2 for the target sequences of these enzymes.)
5'-AAGAATTGCGGAATTCGGGCCTTAAGCGCCGCGTCGAGGCCTTAAA-3'
3'-TTCTTAACGCCTTAAGCCCGGAATTCGCGGCGCAGCTCCGGAATTT-5'

### **QUESTION 10–3 (Page 9)**
Discuss the following statement: "From the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone, the complete amino acid sequence of a protein can be deduced by applying the genetic code. Thus, protein biochemistry has become superfluous because there is nothing more that can be learned by studying the protein."

### **QUESTION 10–4 (Page 11)**
A. If the PCR shown in Figure 10-12 is carried through an additional two rounds of amplification, how many of the DNA fragments (gray, green, red, or outlined in yellow) will be produced? If many additional cycles are carried out, which fragments will predominate?
B. Assume you start with one double-stranded DNA molecule and amplify a 500-nucleotide-pair sequence contained within it. Approximately how many cycles of PCR amplification will you need to produce 100 ng of this DNA? 100 ng is an amount that can be easily detected after staining with a fluorescent dye. (Hint: for this calculation, you need to know that each nucleotide has an average molecular mass of 330 g/mole.)

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 10-5 (Page 31)**
What are the consequences for a dideoxy DNA sequencing reaction if the ratio of dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates to deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates is increased? What happens if this ratio is decreased?

### **QUESTION 10-6 (Page 31)**
Almost all the cells in an individual animal contain identical genomes. In an experiment, a tissue composed of several different cell types is fixed and subjected to in situ hybridization with a DNA probe to a particular gene. To your surprise, the hybridization signal is much stronger in some cells than in others. How might you explain this result?

### **QUESTION 10-7 (Page 31)**
After decades of work, Dr. Ricky M. isolated a small amount of attractase—an enzyme that produces a powerful human pheromone—from hair samples of Hollywood celebrities. To take advantage of attractase for his personal use, he obtained a complete genomic clone of the attractase gene, connected it to a strong bacterial promoter on an expression plasmid, and introduced the plasmid into E. coli cells. He was devastated to find that no attractase was produced in the cells. What is a likely explanation for his failure?

### **QUESTION 10-8 (Page 31)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at specific sites that are always located between genes.
B. DNA migrates toward the positive electrode during electrophoresis.
C. Clones isolated from cDNA libraries contain promoter sequences.
D. PCR utilizes a heat-stable DNA polymerase because for each amplification step, double-stranded DNA must be heat-denatured.
E. Digestion of genomic DNA with AluI, a restriction enzyme that recognizes a four-nucleotide sequence, produces fragments that are all exactly 256 nucleotides in length.
F. To make a cDNA library, both a DNA polymerase and a reverse transcriptase must be used.
G. DNA fingerprinting by PCR relies on the fact that different individuals have different numbers of repeats in STR regions in their genome.
H. It is possible for a coding region of a gene to be present in a genomic library prepared from a particular tissue but to be absent from a cDNA library prepared from the same tissue.

### **QUESTION 10-9 (Page 31)**
A. What is the sequence of the DNA that was used in the sequencing reaction shown in Figure Q10-9? The four lanes show the products of sequencing reactions that contained ddG (lane 1), ddA (lane 2), ddT (lane 3), and ddC (lane 4).
B. This DNA was derived from the middle of a cDNA clone of a mammalian protein. Using the genetic code table (see Figure 7-27), can you determine the amino acid sequence of this portion of the protein?

### **QUESTION 10-10 (Page 32)**
A. How many different DNA fragments would you expect to obtain if you cleaved human genomic DNA with HaeIII? How many fragments would you expect with EcoRI?
B. Human genomic libraries used for DNA sequencing are often made from fragments obtained by cleaving human DNA with HaeIII in such a way that the DNA is only partially digested...What is a possible reason for doing this?

### **QUESTION 10-11 (Page 32)**
A molecule of double-stranded DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes, and the resulting products were separated by gel electrophoresis (Figure Q10-11)...construct a map of the original DNA molecule indicating the relative positions of all the restriction enzyme cleavage sites.

### **QUESTION 10-12 (Page 32)**
There has been a colossal snafu in the maternity ward of your local hospital. Four sets of male twins...were inadvertently shuffled...
A. Which infants are twins? Which are identical twins?
B. How could you match a pair of twins to the correct parents?

### **QUESTION 10-13 (Page 32)**
One of the first organisms that was genetically modified using recombinant DNA technology was a bacterium that normally lives on the surface of strawberry plants...A genetically engineered version of this bacterium was constructed in which the ice-protein gene was knocked out...Do you think that bacteria lacking the ice-protein could be isolated without the use of modern DNA technology? Is it likely that such mutations have already occurred in nature? Would the use of a mutant bacterial strain isolated from nature be of lesser concern?
