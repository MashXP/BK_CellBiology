## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 6–1 (Page 7)**
Look carefully at the micrograph and corresponding sketch (2) in Figure 6-9.
A. Using the scale bar, estimate the lengths of the DNA double helices between the replication forks. Numbering the replication forks sequentially from the left, how long will it take until forks 4 and 5, and forks 7 and 8, respectively, collide with each other? (Recall that the distance between the bases in DNA is 0.34 nm, and eukaryotic replication forks move at about 100 nucleotides per second.) For this question, disregard the nucleosomes seen in the micrograph and assume that the DNA is fully extended.
B. The fly genome is about 1.8 × 10⁸ nucleotide pairs in size. What fraction of the genome is shown in the micrograph?

### **QUESTION 6-2 (Page 14)**
Discuss the following statement: "Primase is a sloppy enzyme that makes many mistakes. Eventually, the RNA primers it makes are removed and replaced with DNA synthesized by a polymerase with higher fidelity. This is wasteful. It would be more energy-efficient if a DNA polymerase were used to make an accurate primer in the first place."

### **QUESTION 6–3 (Page 15)**
A gene encoding one of the proteins involved in DNA replication has been inactivated by a mutation in a cell. In the absence of this protein, the cell attempts to replicate its DNA. What would happen during the DNA replication process if each of the following proteins were missing?
A. DNA polymerase
B. DNA ligase
C. Sliding clamp
D. Nuclease that removes RNA primers
E. DNA helicase
F. Primase

### **QUESTION 6–4 (Page 17)**
Discuss the following statement: "The DNA repair enzymes that fix deamination and depurination damage must preferentially recognize such damage on newly synthesized DNA strands.”

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 6-5 (Page 27)**
DNA mismatch repair enzymes preferentially repair bases on the newly synthesized DNA strand, using the old DNA strand as a template. If mismatches were simply repaired without regard for which strand served as template, would this reduce replication errors as effectively? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 6-6 (Page 27)**
Suppose a mutation affects an enzyme that is required to repair the damage to DNA caused by the loss of purine bases. The loss of a purine occurs about 5000 times in the DNA of each of your cells per day. As the average difference in DNA sequence between humans and chimpanzees is about 1%, how long will it take you to turn into an ape? Or would this transformation be unlikely to occur?

### **QUESTION 6-7 (Page 27)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. A bacterial replication fork is asymmetrical because it contains two DNA polymerase molecules that are structurally distinct.
B. Okazaki fragments are removed by a nuclease that degrades RNA.
C. The error rate of DNA replication is reduced both by proofreading by DNA polymerase and by DNA mismatch repair.
D. In the absence of DNA repair, genes become less stable.
E. None of the aberrant bases formed by deamination occur naturally in DNA.
F. Cancer can result from the accumulation of mutations in somatic cells.

### **QUESTION 6-8 (Page 27)**
The speed of DNA replication at a replication fork is about 100 nucleotides per second in human cells. What is the minimum number of origins of replication that a human cell must have if it is to replicate its DNA once every 24 hours? Recall that a human cell contains two copies of the human genome—one inherited from the mother, the other from the father—each consisting of 3 × 10⁹ nucleotide pairs.

### **QUESTION 6-9 (Page 27)**
Look carefully at Figure 6-11 and at the structures of the compounds shown in Figure Q6-9.
A. What would you expect if ddCTP were added to a DNA replication reaction in large excess over the concentration of the available dCTP, the normal deoxycytidine triphosphate?
B. What would happen if it were added at 10% of the concentration of the available dCTP?
C. What effects would you expect if ddCMP were added under the same conditions?

### **QUESTION 6-10 (Page 28)**
Figure Q6-10 shows a snapshot of a replication fork in which the RNA primer has just been added to the lagging strand. Using this diagram as a guide, sketch the path of the DNA as the next Okazaki fragment is synthesized. Indicate the sliding clamp and the single-strand DNA-binding protein as appropriate.

### **QUESTION 6-11 (Page 28)**
Approximately how many high-energy bonds does DNA polymerase use to replicate a bacterial chromosome (ignoring helicase and other enzymes associated with the replication fork)? Compared with its own dry weight of 10⁻¹² g, how much glucose does a single bacterium need to provide enough energy to copy its DNA once? The number of nucleotide pairs in the bacterial chromosome is 3 x 10⁶. Oxidation of one glucose molecule yields about 30 high-energy phosphate bonds. The molecular weight of glucose is 180 g/mole. (Recall from Figure 2-3 that a mole consists of 6 x 10²³ molecules.)

### **QUESTION 6-12 (Page 28)**
What, if anything, is wrong with the following statement: “DNA stability in both reproductive cells and somatic cells is essential for the survival of a species.” Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 6-13 (Page 28)**
A common type of chemical damage to DNA is produced by a spontaneous reaction termed deamination, in which a nucleotide base loses an amino group (NH₂). ... Write the structures of the bases A, G, C, T, and U and predict the products that will be produced by deamination. By looking at the products of this reaction—and remembering that, in the cell, these will need to be recognized and repaired—can you propose an explanation for why DNA does not contain uracil?

### **QUESTION 6-14 (Page 28)**
A. Explain why telomeres and telomerase are needed for replication of eukaryotic chromosomes but not for replication of circular bacterial chromosomes. Draw a diagram to illustrate your explanation.
B. Would you still need telomeres and telomerase to complete eukaryotic chromosome replication if primase always laid down the RNA primer at the very 3' end of the template for the lagging strand?

### **QUESTION 6-15 (Page 28)**
Describe the consequences that would arise if a eukaryotic chromosome:
A. contained only one origin of replication: (i) at the exact center of the chromosome. (ii) at one end of the chromosome.
B. lacked telomeres.
C. lacked a centromere.
Assume that the chromosome is 150 million nucleotide pairs in length, a typical size for an animal chromosome, and that DNA replication in animal cells proceeds at about 100 nucleotides per second.
