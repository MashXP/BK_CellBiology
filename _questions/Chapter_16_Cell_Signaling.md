## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 16–1 (Page 5)**
To keep their action local, paracrine signal molecules must be prevented from straying too far from their points of origin. Suggest different ways by which this could be accomplished. Explain your answers.

### **QUESTION 16–2 (Page 8)**
In principle, how might an intracellular signaling protein amplify a signal as it relays it onward?

### **QUESTION 16–3 (Page 15)**
GPCRs activate G proteins by reducing the strength of GDP binding to the G protein. This results in rapid dissociation of bound GDP, which is then replaced by GTP...What consequences would result from a mutation in the α subunit of a G protein that caused its affinity for GDP to be reduced without significantly changing its affinity for GTP? Compare the effects of this mutation with the effects of cholera toxin.

### **QUESTION 16–4 (Page 19)**
Explain why cyclic AMP must be broken down rapidly in a cell to allow rapid signaling.

### **QUESTION 16–5 (Page 21)**
Why do you suppose cells have evolved intracellular Ca²⁺ stores for signaling even though there is abundant extracellular Ca²⁺?

### **QUESTION 16–6 (Page 25)**
One important feature of any intracellular signaling pathway is its ability to be turned off. Consider the pathway shown in Figure 16-28. Where would off switches be required? Which ones do you suppose would be the most important?

### **QUESTION 16–7 (Page 29)**
Would you expect to activate RTKs by exposing the exterior of cells to antibodies that bind to the respective proteins? Would your answer be different for GPCRs? (Hint: review Panel 4-2, on pp. 140-141, regarding the properties of antibody molecules.)

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 16-8 (Page 39)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. The extracellular signal molecule acetylcholine has different effects on different cell types...and often binds to different cell-surface receptor molecules...
B. After acetylcholine is secreted from cells, it is long-lived, because it has to reach target cells all over the body.
C. Both the GTP-bound α subunits and nucleotide-free βγ complexes—but not GDP-bound, fully assembled G proteins—can activate other molecules downstream of GPCRs.
D. IP₃ is produced directly by cleavage of an inositol phospholipid without incorporation of an additional phosphate group.
E. Calmodulin regulates the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration.
F. Different signals originating from the plasma membrane can be integrated by cross-talk between different signaling pathways inside the cell.
G. Tyrosine phosphorylation serves to build binding sites for other proteins to bind to RTKs.

### **QUESTION 16-9 (Page 39)**
The Ras protein functions as a molecular switch...You are studying a mutant cell that lacks the GTPase-activating protein. What abnormalities would you expect to find in the way in which Ras activity responds to extracellular signals?

### **QUESTION 16-10 (Page 39)**
A. Compare and contrast signaling by neurons, which secrete neurotransmitters at synapses, with signaling carried out by endocrine cells, which secrete hormones into the blood.
B. Discuss the relative advantages of the two mechanisms.

### **QUESTION 16-11 (Page 39)**
Two intracellular molecules, X and Y, are both normally synthesized at a constant rate of 1000 molecules per second per cell. Molecule X is broken down slowly...Molecule Y is broken down 10 times faster...
A. Calculate how many molecules of X and Y the cell contains at any time.
B. If the rates of synthesis...are suddenly increased tenfold...how many molecules of X and Y will there be after one second?
C. Which molecule would be preferred for rapid signaling?

### **QUESTION 16-12 (Page 40)**
In a series of experiments, genes that code for mutant forms of an RTK are introduced into cells...What would be the consequences of introducing a mutant gene that codes for an RTK (A) lacking its extracellular domain, or (B) lacking its intracellular domain?

### **QUESTION 16-13 (Page 40)**
Discuss the following statement: "Membrane proteins that span the membrane many times can undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding...In contrast, individual single-span membrane proteins cannot transmit a conformational change...but require oligomerization.”

### **QUESTION 16-14 (Page 40)**
What are the similarities and differences between the reactions that lead to the activation of G proteins and the reactions that lead to the activation of Ras?

### **QUESTION 16-15 (Page 40)**
Why do you suppose cells use Ca²⁺...for intracellular signaling and not another ion such as Na⁺...?

### **QUESTION 16-16 (Page 40)**
It seems counterintuitive that a cell, having a perfectly abundant supply of nutrients available, would commit suicide if not constantly stimulated by signals from other cells...What do you suppose might be the advantages of such regulation?

### **QUESTION 16-17 (Page 40)**
The contraction of the myosin-actin system in cardiac muscle cells is triggered by a rise in intracellular Ca²⁺. Cardiac muscle cells have specialized Ca²⁺ channels—called ryanodine receptors...the signaling molecule that opens ryanodine receptors is Ca²⁺ itself. Discuss the consequences of this feature...for cardiac muscle cell contraction.

### **QUESTION 16-18 (Page 40)**
Two protein kinases, K1 and K2, function in an intracellular signaling pathway. If either kinase contains a mutation that permanently inactivates its function, no response is seen...A different mutation in K1 makes it permanently active...In the normal signaling pathway, does K1 activate K2 or does K2 activate K1? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 16-19 (Page 40)**
A. Trace the steps of a long and indirect signaling pathway from a cell-surface receptor to a change in gene expression in the nucleus.
B. Compare this pathway with an example of a short and direct pathway from the cell surface to the nucleus.

### **QUESTION 16-20 (Page 40)**
How does PI 3-kinase activate the Akt kinase after activation of an RTK?

### **QUESTION 16-21 (Page 40)**
Consider the structure of cholesterol...If cholesterol were not normally found in cell membranes, could it be used effectively as a hormone if an appropriate intracellular receptor evolved?

### **QUESTION 16-22 (Page 40)**
The signaling mechanisms used by a steroid-hormone-type nuclear receptor and by an ion-channel-coupled receptor are relatively simple...Can they lead to an amplification of the initial signal, and, if so, how?

### **QUESTION 16-23 (Page 40)**
If some cell-surface receptors, including Notch, can rapidly signal to the nucleus...why do most cell-surface receptors use long, indirect signaling cascades to influence gene transcription in the nucleus?

### **QUESTION 16-24 (Page 40)**
Animal cells and plant cells have some very different intracellular signaling mechanisms but also share some common mechanisms. Why do you think this is so?
