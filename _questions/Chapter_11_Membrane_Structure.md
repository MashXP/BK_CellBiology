## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 11–1 (Page 5)**
Water molecules are said "to reorganize into a cagelike structure” around hydrophobic compounds (e.g., see Figure 11-9). This seems paradoxical because water molecules do not interact with the hydrophobic compound. So how could they "know" about its presence and change their behavior to interact differently with one another? Discuss this argument and, in doing so, develop a clear concept of what is meant by a "cagelike" structure. How does it compare to ice? Why would this cagelike structure be energetically unfavorable?

### **QUESTION 11–2 (Page 8)**
Five students in your class always sit together in the front row. This could be because (A) they really like each other or (B) nobody else in your class wants to sit next to them. Which explanation holds for the assembly of a lipid bilayer? Explain. Suppose, instead, that the other explanation held for lipid molecules. How would the properties of the lipid bilayer be different?

### **QUESTION 11–3 (Page 10)**
It seems paradoxical that a lipid bilayer can be fluid yet asymmetrical. Explain.

### **QUESTION 11–4 (Page 14)**
Explain why the polypeptide chain of most transmembrane proteins crosses the lipid bilayer as an α helix or a β barrel.

### **QUESTION 11–5 (Page 15)**
For the two detergents shown in Figure 11-26, explain why the blue portions of the molecules are hydrophilic and the red portions hydrophobic. Draw a short stretch of a polypeptide chain made up of three amino acids with hydrophobic side chains (see Panel 2–6, pp. 76-77) and apply a similar color scheme. Indicate which portions of your polypeptide would form hydrogen bonds with water.

### **QUESTION 11–6 (Page 17)**
Look carefully at the transmembrane proteins shown in Figure 11-29B. What can you say about their mobility in the membrane?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 11-7 (Page 23)**
Describe the different methods that cells use to restrict proteins to specific regions of the plasma membrane. Can a membrane with many of its proteins restricted still be fluid?

### **QUESTION 11-8 (Page 23)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Lipids in a lipid bilayer spin rapidly around their long axis.
B. Lipids in a lipid bilayer rapidly exchange positions with one another in their own monolayer.
C. Lipids in a lipid bilayer do not flip-flop readily from one lipid monolayer to the other.
D. Hydrogen bonds that form between lipid head groups and water molecules are continually broken and re-formed.
E. Glycolipids move between different membrane-enclosed compartments during their synthesis but remain restricted to one side of the lipid bilayer.
F. Margarine contains more saturated lipids than the vegetable oil from which it is made.
G. Some membrane proteins are enzymes.
H. The sugar layer that surrounds all cells makes cells more slippery.

### **QUESTION 11-9 (Page 23)**
What is meant by the term "two-dimensional fluid"?

### **QUESTION 11-10 (Page 23)**
The structure of a lipid bilayer is determined by the particular properties of its lipid molecules. What would happen if:
A. phospholipids had only one hydrocarbon tail instead of two?
B. the hydrocarbon tails were shorter than normal, say, about 10 carbon atoms long?
C. all of the hydrocarbon tails were saturated?
D. all of the hydrocarbon tails were unsaturated?
E. the bilayer contained a mixture of two kinds of phospholipid molecules, one with two saturated hydrocarbon tails and the other with two unsaturated hydrocarbon tails?
F. each phospholipid molecule were covalently linked through the end carbon atom of one of its hydrocarbon tails to a phospholipid tail in the opposite monolayer?

### **QUESTION 11-11 (Page 23)**
What are the differences between a phospholipid molecule and a detergent molecule? How would the structure of a phospholipid molecule need to change to make it a detergent?

### **QUESTION 11-12 (Page 23)**
A. Membrane lipid molecules exchange places with their lipid neighbors every 10⁻⁷ second. A lipid molecule diffuses from one end of a 2-µm-long bacterial cell to the other in about 0.2 seconds. Are these two numbers in agreement?
B. To get an appreciation for the great speed of molecular diffusion, assume that a lipid head group is about the size of a ping-pong ball... If two neighboring balls exchanged positions once every 10⁻⁷ second, what would their speed be in kilometers per hour?

### **QUESTION 11-13 (Page 24)**
Why does a red blood cell plasma membrane need transmembrane proteins?

### **QUESTION 11-14 (Page 24)**
Consider a transmembrane protein that forms a hydrophilic pore across the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell...propose a possible arrangement of the five membrane-spanning α helices in the membrane.

### **QUESTION 11-15 (Page 24)**
In the membrane of a human red blood cell, the ratio of the mass of protein (average molecular weight 50,000) to phospholipid (molecular weight 800) to cholesterol (molecular weight 386) is about 2:1:1. How many lipid molecules are there for every protein molecule?

### **QUESTION 11-16 (Page 24)**
Draw a schematic diagram that shows a close-up view of two plasma membranes as they come together during cell fusion, as shown in Figure 11-30...Will the fluorescent labels remain on the outside of the hybrid cell after cell fusion and still be there after the mixing of membrane proteins that occurs during the incubation at 37°C? How would the experimental outcome be different if the incubation were done at 0°C?

### **QUESTION 11-17 (Page 24)**
Compare the hydrophobic forces that hold a membrane protein in the lipid bilayer with those that help proteins fold into a unique three-dimensional structure.

A. Antarctic fish
B. Desert snake
C. Human being
D. Polar bear
E. Thermophilic bacterium that lives in hot springs at 100°C.
