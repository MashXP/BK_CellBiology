## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 17–1 (Page 7)**

A. Amoeba proteus (a free-living amoeba)
B. Skin epithelial cell
C. Smooth muscle cell in the digestive tract
D. Escherichia coli
E. Nerve cell in the spinal cord
F. Sperm cell
G. Plant cell

### **QUESTION 17–2 (Page 12)**
Why do you suppose it is much easier to add tubulin to existing microtubules than to start a new microtubule from scratch? Explain how γ-tubulin in the centrosome helps to overcome this hurdle.

### **QUESTION 17–3 (Page 14)**
Dynamic instability causes microtubules either to grow or to shrink rapidly. Consider an individual microtubule that is in its shrinking phase.
A. What must happen at the end of the microtubule in order for it to stop shrinking and to start growing again?
B. How would a change in the tubulin concentration affect this switch?
C. What would happen if only GDP, but no GTP, were present in the solution?
D. What would happen if the solution contained an analog of GTP that cannot be hydrolyzed?

### **QUESTION 17–4 (Page 19)**
Dynein arms in a cilium are arranged so that, when activated, the heads push their neighboring outer doublet outward toward the tip of the cilium...Why would no bending motion of the cilium result if all dynein molecules were active at the same time? What pattern of dynein activity can account for the bending of a cilium in one direction?

### **QUESTION 17–5 (Page 22)**
The formation of actin filaments in the cytosol is controlled by actin-binding proteins. Some actin-binding proteins significantly increase the rate at which the formation of an actin filament is initiated. Suggest a mechanism by which they might do this.

### **QUESTION 17–6 (Page 25)**
Suppose that the actin molecules in a cultured skin cell have been randomly labeled in such a way that 1 in 10,000 molecules carries a fluorescent marker. What would you expect to see if you examined the lamellipodium (leading edge) of this cell through a fluorescence microscope? Assume that your microscope is sensitive enough to detect single fluorescent molecules.

### **QUESTION 17–7 (Page 27)**
At the leading edge of a crawling cell, the plus ends of actin filaments are located close to the plasma membrane, and actin monomers are added at these ends, pushing the membrane outward to form lamellipodia or filopodia. What do you suppose holds the filaments at their other ends to prevent them from just being pushed into the cell's interior?

### **QUESTION 17–8 (Page 29)**
If both the actin and myosin filaments of muscle are made up of subunits held together by weak noncovalent bonds, how is it possible for a human being to lift heavy objects?

### **QUESTION 17–9 (Page 32)**
Compare the structure of intermediate filaments with that of the myosin-II filaments in skeletal muscle cells. What are the major similarities? What are the major differences? How do the differences in structure relate to their function?

### **QUESTION 17–10 (Page 33)**
A. Note that in Figure 17-46, troponin molecules are evenly spaced along an actin filament, with one troponin found every seventh actin molecule. How do you suppose troponin molecules can be positioned this regularly?
B. What do you suppose would happen if you mixed actin filaments with (i) troponin alone, (ii) tropomyosin alone, or (iii) troponin plus tropomyosin, and then added myosin? Would the effects be dependent on Ca²⁺?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 17-11 (Page 35)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Kinesin moves ER membranes along microtubules so that the network of ER tubules becomes stretched throughout the cell.
B. Without actin, cells can form a functional mitotic spindle and pull their chromosomes apart but cannot divide.
C. Lamellipodia and filopodia are "feelers” that a cell extends to find anchor points on the substratum that it will then crawl over.
D. GTP is hydrolyzed by tubulin to cause the bending of flagella.
E. Cells having an intermediate-filament network that cannot be depolymerized would die.
F. The plus ends of microtubules grow faster because they have a larger GTP cap.
G. The transverse tubules in muscle cells are an extension of the plasma membrane...
H. Activation of myosin movement on actin filaments is triggered by the phosphorylation of troponin...and by Ca²⁺ binding to troponin in others.

### **QUESTION 17-12 (Page 35)**
The average time taken for a molecule or an organelle to diffuse a distance of x cm is given by the formula t = x²/2D...calculate the time it would take for a small molecule, a protein, and a membrane vesicle to diffuse from one side to another of a cell 10 µm across...How long would a membrane vesicle take to reach the end of an axon 10 cm long by free diffusion? How long would it take if it was transported along microtubules at 1 µm/sec?

### **QUESTION 17-13 (Page 35)**
Why do eukaryotic cells, and especially animal cells, have such large and complex cytoskeletons? List the differences between animal cells and bacteria that depend on the eukaryotic cytoskeleton.

### **QUESTION 17-14 (Page 35)**
Examine the structure of an intermediate filament shown in Figure 17-4. Does the filament have a unique polarity...could you distinguish one end from the other by chemical or other means? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 17-15 (Page 35)**
There are no known motor proteins that move on intermediate filaments. Suggest an explanation for this.

### **QUESTION 17-16 (Page 36)**
When cells enter mitosis, their existing array of cytoplasmic microtubules has to be rapidly broken down and replaced with the mitotic spindle...The enzyme katanin...is activated during the onset of mitosis, and chops microtubules into short pieces. What do you suppose is the fate of the microtubule fragments created by katanin?

### **QUESTION 17-17 (Page 36)**
The drug Taxol...has an opposite effect to the drug colchicine...Taxol binds tightly to microtubules and stabilizes them...colchicine prevents microtubule formation...suggest why both drugs are toxic to dividing cells despite their opposite actions.

### **QUESTION 17-18 (Page 36)**
A useful technique for studying microtubule motors is to attach them by their tails to a glass cover slip...In which direction will microtubules crawl on a "bed" of kinesin molecules?

### **QUESTION 17-19 (Page 36)**
A typical time course of polymerization of purified tubulin to form microtubules is shown in Figure Q17-19.
A. Explain the different parts of the curve (labeled A, B, and C).
B. How would the curve in the figure change if centrosomes were added at the outset?

### **QUESTION 17-20 (Page 36)**
The electron micrographs shown in Figure Q17-20A were obtained from a population of microtubules that were growing rapidly. Figure Q17-20B was obtained from microtubules undergoing "catastrophic" shrinking. Comment on any differences between A and B, and suggest likely explanations for the differences that you observe.

### **QUESTION 17-21 (Page 36)**
The locomotion of fibroblasts in culture is immediately halted by the drug cytochalasin, whereas colchicine causes fibroblasts to cease to move directionally...Injection of fibroblasts with antibodies to the intermediate filament protein vimentin has no discernible effect on their migration. What do these observations suggest to you about the involvement of the three different cytoskeletal filaments in fibroblast locomotion?

### **QUESTION 17-22 (Page 36)**
Complete the following sentence accurately...The role of calcium in muscle contraction is:
A. to detach myosin heads from actin.
B. to spread the action potential from the plasma membrane to the contractile machinery.
C. to bind to troponin, cause it to move tropomyosin, and thereby expose actin filaments to myosin heads.
D. to maintain the structure of the myosin filament.

### **QUESTION 17-23 (Page 36)**
Which of the following changes takes place when a skeletal muscle contracts?
A. Z discs move farther apart.
B. Actin filaments contract.
C. Myosin filaments contract.
D. Sarcomeres become shorter.
