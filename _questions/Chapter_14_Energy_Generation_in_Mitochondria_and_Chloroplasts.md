## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 14–1 (Page 3)**
Dinitrophenol (DNP) is a small molecule that renders membranes permeable to protons. In the 1940s, small amounts of this highly toxic compound were given to patients to induce weight loss. DNP was effective in melting away the pounds, especially promoting the loss of fat reserves. Can you explain how it might cause such loss? As an unpleasant side reaction, however, patients had an elevated temperature and sweated profusely during the treatment. Provide an explanation for these symptoms.

### **QUESTION 14–2 (Page 7)**
Electron micrographs show that mitochondria in heart muscle have a much higher density of cristae than mitochondria in skin cells. Suggest an explanation for this observation.

### **QUESTION 14–3 (Page 11)**
When the drug dinitrophenol (DNP) is added to mitochondria, the inner membrane becomes permeable to protons (H⁺). In contrast, when the drug nigericin is added to mitochondria, the inner membrane becomes permeable to K⁺. (A) How does the electrochemical proton gradient change in response to DNP? (B) How does it change in response to nigericin?

### **QUESTION 14–4 (Page 13)**
The remarkable properties that allow ATP synthase to run in either direction allow the interconversion of energy stored in the H⁺ gradient and energy stored in ATP to proceed in either direction. (A) If ATP synthase making ATP can be likened to a water-driven turbine producing electricity, what would be an appropriate analogy when it works in the opposite direction? (B) Under what conditions would one expect the ATP synthase to stall, running neither forward nor backward? (C) What determines the direction in which the ATP synthase operates?

### **QUESTION 14–5 (Page 15)**
Calculate the number of usable ATP molecules produced per pair of electrons transferred from NADH to oxygen if (i) five protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane for each electron passed through the three respiratory enzyme complexes, (ii) three protons must pass through the ATP synthase for each ATP molecule that it produces from ADP and inorganic phosphate inside the mitochondrion, and (iii) one proton is used to produce the voltage gradient needed to transport each ATP molecule out of the mitochondrion to the cytosol where it is used.

### **QUESTION 14–6 (Page 19)**
At many steps in the electron-transport chain, Fe ions are used as part of heme or FeS clusters to bind the electrons in transit. Why do these functional groups that carry out the chemistry of electron transfer need to be bound to proteins? Provide several reasons why this is necessary.

### **QUESTION 14–7 (Page 20)**
Two different diffusible electron carriers, ubiquinone and cytochrome c, shuttle electrons between the three protein complexes of the electron-transport chain. Could the same diffusible carrier, in principle, be used for both steps? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 14–8 (Page 25)**
Chloroplasts have a third internal compartment, the thylakoid space, bounded by the thylakoid membrane. This membrane contains the photosystems, reaction centers, electron-transport chain, and ATP synthase...Why does this arrangement allow a larger H⁺ gradient in chloroplasts than can be achieved for mitochondria?

### **QUESTION 14–9 (Page 29)**
Both NADPH and the related carrier molecule NADH are strong electron donors. Why might plant cells have evolved to rely on NADPH, rather than NADH, to provide the reducing power for biosynthesis?

### **QUESTION 14–10 (Page 32)**
A. How do cells in plant roots survive, since they contain no chloroplasts and are not exposed to light?
B. Unlike mitochondria, chloroplasts do not have a transporter that allows them to export ATP to the cytosol. How, then, do plant cells obtain the ATP that they need to carry out energy-requiring metabolic reactions in the cytosol?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 14-11 (Page 38)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. After an electron has been removed by light, the positively charged chlorophyll in the reaction center of the first photosystem (photosystem II) has a greater affinity for electrons than O₂ has.
B. Photosynthesis is the light-driven transfer of an electron from chlorophyll to a second molecule that normally has a much lower affinity for electrons.
C. Because it requires the removal of four electrons to release one O₂ molecule from two H₂O molecules, the water-splitting enzyme in photosystem II has to keep the reaction intermediates tightly bound...

### **QUESTION 14-12 (Page 38)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Many, but not all, electron-transfer reactions involve metal ions.
B. The electron-transport chain generates an electrical potential across the membrane because it moves electrons from the intermembrane space into the matrix.
C. The electrochemical proton gradient consists of two components: a pH difference and an electrical potential.
D. Ubiquinone and cytochrome c are both diffusible electron carriers.
E. Plants have chloroplasts and therefore can live without mitochondria.
F. Both chlorophyll and heme contain an extensive system of double bonds that allows them to absorb visible light.
G. The role of chlorophyll in photosynthesis is equivalent to that of heme in mitochondrial electron transport.
H. Most of the dry weight of a tree comes from the minerals that are taken up by the roots.

### **QUESTION 14-13 (Page 39)**
A single proton moving down its electrochemical gradient into the mitochondrial matrix space liberates 19.2 kJ/mole of free energy (ΔG). How many protons have to flow across the inner mitochondrial membrane to synthesize one molecule of ATP if the ΔG for ATP synthesis under intracellular conditions is between 46 and 54 kJ/mole?

### **QUESTION 14-14 (Page 39)**
In the following statement, choose the correct one of the alternatives in italics and justify your answers. "If no O₂ is available, all components of the mitochondrial electron-transport chain will accumulate in their *reduced/oxidized* form. If O₂ is suddenly added again, the electron carriers in cytochrome c oxidase will become *reduced/oxidized* *before/after* those in NADH dehydrogenase.”

### **QUESTION 14-15 (Page 39)**
Assume that the conversion of oxidized ubiquinone to reduced ubiquinone by NADH dehydrogenase occurs on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane and that its oxidation by cytochrome c reductase occurs on the intermembrane-space side...What are the consequences of this arrangement for the generation of the H⁺ gradient across the membrane?

### **QUESTION 14-16 (Page 39)**
If a voltage is applied to two platinum wires (electrodes) immersed in water, then water molecules become split into H₂ and O₂ gas...When photosynthetic bacteria and plant cells split water, they produce O₂ but no H₂. Why?

### **QUESTION 14-17 (Page 39)**
In an insightful experiment performed in the 1960s, chloroplasts were first soaked in an acidic solution at pH 4...They were then transferred to a basic solution (pH 8)...A burst of ATP synthesis was observed...
A. Explain why these conditions lead to ATP synthesis.
B. Is light needed for the experiment to work?
C. What would happen if the solutions were switched...?

### **QUESTION 14-19 (Page 40)**
FADH₂ is produced in the citric acid cycle by a membrane-embedded enzyme complex...The redox potential of FADH₂, however, is only –220 mV. Referring to Panel 14–1 and Figure 14-22, suggest a plausible mechanism by which its electrons could be fed into the electron-transport chain.

### **QUESTION 14-20 (Page 40)**

### **QUESTION 14-22 (Page 40)**
A manuscript has been submitted for publication...the authors describe an experiment in which they have succeeded in trapping an individual ATP synthase molecule and then mechanically rotating its head by applying a force to it. The authors show that upon rotating the head of the ATP synthase, ATP is produced, in the absence of an H⁺ gradient. What might this mean about the mechanism whereby ATP synthase functions?
