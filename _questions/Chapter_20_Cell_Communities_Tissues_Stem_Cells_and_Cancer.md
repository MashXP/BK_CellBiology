## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 20–1 (Page 6)**
Cells in the stem of a seedling that is grown in the dark orient their microtubules horizontally. How would you expect this to affect the growth of the plant?

### **QUESTION 20–2 (Page 7)**
Mutations in the genes encoding collagens often have detrimental consequences, resulting in severely crippling diseases...Would you expect collagen mutations to be detrimental if only one of the two copies of a collagen gene is defective?

### **QUESTION 20–3 (Page 11)**
Proteoglycans are characterized by the abundance of negative charges on their sugar chains. How would the properties of these molecules differ if the negative charges were not as abundant?

### **QUESTION 20–4 (Page 17)**
Analogs of hemidesmosomes are the focal contacts described in Chapter 17...Why do you suppose these two different cell types attach differently to the extracellular matrix?

### **QUESTION 20–5 (Page 18)**
Gap junctions are dynamic structures that, like conventional ion channels, are gated...The permeability of gap junctions decreases within seconds, for example, when the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration is raised. Speculate why this form of regulation by Ca²⁺ might be important for the health of a tissue.

### **QUESTION 20–6 (Page 22)**
Why does ionizing radiation stop cell division?

### **QUESTION 20–7 (Page 23)**
Why do you suppose epithelial cells lining the gut are lost and replaced (renewed) frequently, whereas most neurons last for the lifetime of the organism?

### **QUESTION 20–8 (Page 33)**
About 10¹⁶ cell divisions take place in a human body during a lifetime, yet an adult human body consists of only about 10¹³ cells. How can you reconcile these apparently conflicting two numbers?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 20-9 (Page 43)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Gap junctions connect the cytoskeleton of one cell to that of a neighboring cell or to the extracellular matrix.
B. A wilted plant leaf can be likened to a deflated bicycle tire.
C. Because of their rigid structure, proteoglycans can withstand a large amount of compressive force.
D. The basal lamina is a specialized layer of extracellular matrix to which sheets of epithelial cells are attached.
E. Epidermal cells in the skin are continually shed and are renewed every few weeks; for a tattoo to be long-lasting, it is therefore necessary to deposit pigment below the epidermis.
F. Although stem cells are not differentiated, they are specialized in the sense that they give rise only to specific cell types.

### **QUESTION 20-10 (Page 43)**
Which of the following substances would you expect to spread from one cell to the next through (a) gap junctions and (b) plasmodesmata: glutamic acid, mRNA, cyclic AMP, Ca²⁺, proteins, and plasma membrane phospholipids?

### **QUESTION 20-11 (Page 43)**
Discuss the following statement: "If plant cells contained intermediate filaments to provide the cells with tensile strength, their cell walls would be dispensable.”

### **QUESTION 20-12 (Page 43)**
Through the exchange of small metabolites and ions, gap junctions provide metabolic and electrical coupling between cells. Why, then, do you suppose that neurons communicate primarily through chemical synapses...rather than through gap junctions?

### **QUESTION 20-13 (Page 43)**
Gelatin is primarily composed of collagen...yet, jello has virtually no tensile strength. Why?

### **QUESTION 20-14 (Page 43)**
"The structure of an organism is determined by the genome that the fertilized egg contains." What is the evidence on which this statement is based? Indeed, a friend challenges you and suggests that you replace the DNA of a stork's egg with human DNA to see if a human baby results. How would you answer him?

### **QUESTION 20-15 (Page 43)**
Leukemias—that is, cancers arising through mutations that cause excessive production of white blood cells—have an earlier average age of onset than other cancers. Propose an explanation for why this might be the case.

### **QUESTION 20-16 (Page 43)**
Carefully consider the graph in Figure 20-43, which shows the number of cases of colon cancer diagnosed per 100,000 women per year as a function of age. Why is this graph so steep and curved, if mutations occur with a similar frequency throughout a person's life-span?

### **QUESTION 20-17 (Page 44)**
Heavy smokers or industrial workers exposed for a limited time to a chemical carcinogen...do not usually begin to develop cancers...until 10, 20, or even more years after the exposure. Suggest an explanation for this long delay.

### **QUESTION 20-18 (Page 44)**
High levels of the female sex hormone estrogen increase the risk of some forms of cancer...Can one infer that estrogens and androgens are mutagenic?

### **QUESTION 20-19 (Page 44)**
Is cancer hereditary?
