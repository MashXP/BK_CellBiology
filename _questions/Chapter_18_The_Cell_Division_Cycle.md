## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 18–1 (Page 2)**
Consider the following statement: "All present-day cells have arisen by an uninterrupted series of cell divisions extending back in time to the first cell division." Is this strictly true?

### **QUESTION 18–2 (Page 4)**
A population of proliferating cells is stained with a dye that becomes fluorescent when it binds to DNA...The number of cells with a given DNA content is plotted on the graph below. Indicate on the graph where you would expect to find cells that are in G₁, S, G₂, and mitosis. Which is the longest phase of the cell cycle in this population of cells?

### **QUESTION 18–3 (Page 12)**
Why do you suppose cells have evolved a special G₀ phase to exit from the cell cycle, rather than just stopping in G₁ and not moving on to S phase?

### **QUESTION 18–4 (Page 14)**
What might be the consequences if a cell replicated damaged DNA before repairing it?

### **QUESTION 18–5 (Page 17)**
A small amount of cytoplasm isolated from a mitotic cell is injected into an unfertilized frog oocyte, causing the oocyte to enter M phase...Explain this remarkable observation.

### **QUESTION 18–6 (Page 26)**
If fine glass needles are used to manipulate a chromosome inside a living cell during early M phase, it is possible to trick the kinetochores on the two sister chromatids into attaching to the same spindle pole. This arrangement is normally unstable, but the attachments can be stabilized if the needle is used to gently pull the chromosome so that the microtubules attached to both kinetochores are under tension. What does this suggest to you about the mechanism by which kinetochores normally become attached and stay attached to microtubules from opposite spindle poles?

### **QUESTION 18–7 (Page 28)**
Consider the events that lead to the formation of the new nucleus at telophase. How do nuclear and cytosolic proteins become properly re-sorted so that the new nucleus contains nuclear proteins but not cytosolic proteins?

### **QUESTION 18–8 (Page 30)**
Draw a detailed view of the formation of the new cell wall that separates the two daughter cells when a plant cell divides...show where the membrane proteins of the Golgi-derived vesicles end up, indicating what happens to the part of a protein in the Golgi vesicle membrane that is exposed to the interior of the Golgi vesicle.

### **QUESTION 18–9 (Page 31)**
The Golgi apparatus is thought to be partitioned into the daughter cells at cell division by a random distribution of fragments that are created at mitosis. Explain why random partitioning of chromosomes would not work.

### **QUESTION 18–10 (Page 33)**
Why do you think apoptosis occurs by a different mechanism from the cell death that occurs in cell necrosis? What might be the consequences if apoptosis were not achieved in so neat and orderly a fashion...?

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 18-11 (Page 40)**
Roughly, how long would it take a single fertilized human egg to make a cluster of cells weighing 70 kg by repeated divisions, if each cell weighs 1 nanogram just after cell division and each cell cycle takes 24 hours? Why does it take very much longer than this to make a 70 kg adult human?

### **QUESTION 18-12 (Page 40)**
The shortest eukaryotic cell cycles of all—shorter even than those of many bacteria—occur in many early animal embryos...How can this be? Which phase of the cell cycle would you expect to be most reduced?

### **QUESTION 18-13 (Page 40)**
One important biological effect of a large dose of ionizing radiation is to halt cell division.
A. How does this occur?
B. What happens if a cell has a mutation that prevents it from halting cell division after being irradiated?
C. What might be the effects of such a mutation if the cell is not irradiated?
D. An adult human who has reached maturity will die within a few days of receiving a radiation dose large enough to stop cell division. What does that tell you?

### **QUESTION 18-14 (Page 40)**
If cells are grown in a culture medium containing radioactive thymidine, the thymidine will be covalently incorporated into the cell's DNA during S phase...
A. Would all cells...be expected to contain radioactive DNA after the labeling procedure?
B. Initially, there are no mitotic cells that contain radioactive DNA. Why is this?
C. Explain the rise and fall and then rise again of the curve.
D. Estimate the length of the G₂ phase from this graph.

### **QUESTION 18-15 (Page 40)**
One of the functions of M-Cdk is to cause a precipitous drop in M cyclin concentration halfway through M phase. Describe the consequences of this sudden decrease and suggest possible mechanisms by which it might occur.

### **QUESTION 18-16 (Page 40)**
Figure 18-5 shows the rise of M cyclin concentration and the rise of M-Cdk activity in cells as they progress through the cell cycle...How do you think this difference arises?

### **QUESTION 18-17 (Page 40)**
What is the order in which the following events occur during cell division?
A. anaphase; B. metaphase; C. prometaphase; D. telophase; E. mitosis; F. prophase. Where does cytokinesis fit in?

### **QUESTION 18-18 (Page 40)**
The lifetime of a microtubule in a mammalian cell...varies with the stage of the cell cycle...If the average length of a microtubule in interphase is 20 µm, how long will it be during mitosis...?

### **QUESTION 18-19 (Page 40)**
The balance between plus-end directed and minus-end directed motor proteins that bind to interpolar microtubules...is thought to help determine the length of the spindle. How might each type of motor protein contribute to the determination of spindle length?

### **QUESTION 18-20 (Page 41)**
Sketch the principal stages of mitosis, using Panel 18-1 as a guide. Color one sister chromatid and follow it through mitosis and cytokinesis. What event commits this chromatid to a particular daughter cell?

### **QUESTION 18-21 (Page 41)**
The polar movement of chromosomes during anaphase A is associated with microtubule shortening...Sketch a model that explains how a microtubule can shorten and generate force yet remain firmly attached to the chromosome.

### **QUESTION 18-22 (Page 41)**
Rarely, both sister chromatids of a replicated chromosome end up in one daughter cell. How might this happen? What could be the consequences of such a mitotic error?

### **QUESTION 18-23 (Page 41)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Centrosomes are replicated before M phase begins.
B. Two sister chromatids arise by replication of the DNA of the same chromosome...
C. Interpolar microtubules attach end-to-end and are therefore continuous from one spindle pole to the other.
D. Microtubule polymerization and depolymerization and microtubule motor proteins are all required for DNA replication.
E. Microtubules nucleate at the centromeres and then connect to the kinetochores...

### **QUESTION 18-24 (Page 41)**
An antibody that binds to myosin prevents the movement of myosin molecules along actin filaments...What might be the result of injecting this antibody into cells (A) on the movement of chromosomes at anaphase or (B) on cytokinesis?

### **QUESTION 18-25 (Page 41)**
