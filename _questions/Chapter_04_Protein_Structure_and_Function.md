## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 4–1 (Page 7)**
Urea, used in the experiment shown in Figure 4-7, is a molecule that disrupts the hydrogen-bonded network of water molecules. Why might high concentrations of urea unfold proteins? The structure of urea is shown here: O=C(NH₂)₂.

### **QUESTION 4–2 (Page 11)**
Remembering that the amino acid side chains projecting from each polypeptide backbone in a β sheet point alternately above and below the plane of the sheet (see Figure 4-13A), consider the following protein sequence: Leu-Lys-Val-Asp-Ile-Ser-Leu-Arg-Leu-Lys-Ile-Arg-Phe-Glu. Do you find anything remarkable about the arrangement of the amino acids in this sequence when incorporated into a β sheet? Can you make any predictions as to how the β sheet might be arranged in a protein? (Hint: consult the properties of the amino acids listed in Figure 4-3.)

### **QUESTION 4-3 (Page 16)**
Random mutations only very rarely result in changes that improve a protein's usefulness for the cell, yet useful mutations are selected in evolution. Because these changes are so rare, for each useful mutation there are innumerable mutations that lead to either no improvement or inactive proteins. Why, then, do cells not contain millions of proteins that are of no use?

### **QUESTION 4–4 (Page 21)**
Hair is composed largely of fibers of the protein keratin. Individual keratin fibers are covalently cross-linked to one another by many disulfide (S–S) bonds. If curly hair is treated with mild reducing agents that break a few of the cross-links, pulled straight, and then oxidized again, it remains straight. Draw a diagram that illustrates the three different stages of this chemical and mechanical process at the level of the keratin filaments, focusing on the disulfide bonds. What do you think would happen if hair were treated with strong reducing agents that break all the disulfide bonds?

### **QUESTION 4–5 (Page 27)**
Use drawings to explain how an enzyme (such as hexokinase, mentioned in the text) can distinguish its normal substrate (here, D-glucose) from the optical isomer L-glucose, which is not a substrate. (Hint: remembering that a carbon atom forms four single bonds that are tetrahedrally arranged and that the optical isomers are mirror images of each other around such a bond, draw the substrate as a simple tetrahedron with four different corners and then draw its mirror image. Using this drawing, indicate why only one optical isomer might bind to a schematic active site of an enzyme.)

### **QUESTION 4–6 (Page 34)**
Consider the drawing in Figure 4-42. What will happen if, instead of the indicated feedback,
A. feedback inhibition from Z affects the step B → C only?
B. feedback inhibition from Z affects the step Y → Z only?
C. Z is a positive regulator of the step B → X?
D. Z is a positive regulator of the step B → C?
For each case, discuss how useful these regulatory schemes would be for a cell.

### **QUESTION 4–7 (Page 38)**
Either protein phosphorylation or the binding of a nucleotide (such as ATP or GTP) can be used to regulate a protein's activity. What do you suppose are the advantages of each form of regulation?

### **QUESTION 4–8 (Page 40)**
Explain why the hypothetical enzymes in Figure 4-51 have a great advantage in opening the safe if they work together in a protein complex, as opposed to working individually in an unlinked, sequential manner.

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 4-9 (Page 54)**
Look at the models of the protein in Figure 4-11. Is the red α helix right- or left-handed? Are the three strands that form the large β sheet parallel or antiparallel? Starting at the N-terminus (the purple end), trace your finger along the peptide backbone. Are there any knots? Why, or why not?

### **QUESTION 4-10 (Page 54)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. The active site of an enzyme usually occupies only a small fraction of the enzyme surface.
B. Catalysis by some enzymes involves the formation of a covalent bond between an amino acid side chain and a substrate molecule.
C. A β sheet can contain up to five strands, but no more.
D. The specificity of an antibody molecule is contained exclusively in loops on the surface of the folded light-chain domain.
E. The possible linear arrangements of amino acids are so vast that new proteins almost never evolve by alteration of old ones.
F. Allosteric enzymes have two or more binding sites.
G. Noncovalent bonds are too weak to influence the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules.
H. Affinity chromatography separates molecules according to their intrinsic charge.
I. Upon centrifugation of a cell homogenate, smaller organelles experience less friction and thereby sediment faster than larger ones.

### **QUESTION 4-11 (Page 54)**
What common feature of α helices and β sheets makes them universal building blocks for proteins?

### **QUESTION 4-12 (Page 54)**
Protein structure is determined solely by a protein's amino acid sequence. Should a genetically engineered protein in which the original order of all amino acids is reversed have the same structure as the original protein?

### **QUESTION 4-13 (Page 54)**
Consider the following protein sequence as an α helix: Leu-Lys-Arg-Ile-Val-Asp-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Leu-Phe-Lys-Val. How many turns does this helix make? Do you find anything remarkable about the arrangement of the amino acids in this sequence when folded into an α helix? (Hint: consult the properties of the amino acids in Figure 4-3.)

### **QUESTION 4-14 (Page 54)**
Simple enzyme reactions often conform to the equation: E + S ↔ ES → EP ↔ E + P
A. What does ES represent in this equation?
B. Why is the first step shown with bidirectional arrows and the second step as a unidirectional arrow?
C. Why does E appear at both ends of the equation?
D. One often finds that high concentrations of P inhibit the enzyme. Suggest why this might occur.
E. If compound X resembles S and binds to the active site of the enzyme but cannot undergo the reaction catalyzed by it, what effects would you expect the addition of X to the reaction to have? Compare the effects of X and of the accumulation of P.

### **QUESTION 4-15 (Page 55)**
Which of the following amino acids would you expect to find more often near the center of a folded globular protein? Which ones would you expect to find more often exposed to the outside? Ser, Ser-P, Leu, Lys, Gln, His, Phe, Val, Ile, Met, Cys-S-S-Cys, and Glu. Where would you expect to find the most N-terminal amino acid and the most C-terminal amino acid?

### **QUESTION 4-16 (Page 55)**
Assume you want to make and study fragments of a protein. Would you expect that any fragment of the polypeptide chain would fold the same way as it would in the intact protein? Consider the protein shown in Figure 4-20. Which fragments do you suppose are most likely to fold correctly?

### **QUESTION 4-17 (Page 55)**
Neurofilament proteins assemble into long, intermediate filaments...The C-terminal region of these proteins is an unstructured polypeptide, hundreds of amino acids long and heavily modified by the addition of phosphate groups. The term “polymer brush” has been applied to this part of the neurofilament. Can you suggest why?

### **QUESTION 4-18 (Page 55)**
An enzyme isolated from a mutant bacterium grown at 20°C works in a test tube at 20°C but not at 37°C. ... once the enzyme has been exposed to the higher temperature, it no longer works at the lower one. The same enzyme isolated from the normal bacterium works at both temperatures. Can you suggest what happens (at the molecular level) to the mutant enzyme as the temperature increases?

### **QUESTION 4-19 (Page 55)**
A motor protein moves along protein filaments in the cell. Why are the elements shown in the illustration not sufficient to mediate directed movement (Figure Q4-19)? With reference to Figure 4-50, modify the illustration shown here to include other elements that are required to create a unidirectional motor, and justify each modification you make to the illustration.

### **QUESTION 4-20 (Page 55)**
Gel-filtration chromatography separates molecules according to their size. Smaller molecules diffuse faster in solution than larger ones, yet smaller molecules migrate more slowly through a gel-filtration column than larger ones. Explain this paradox. What should happen at very rapid flow rates?

### **QUESTION 4-21 (Page 55)**
As shown in Figure 4-16, both α helices and the coiled-coil structures that can form from them are helical structures, but do they have the same handedness in the figure? Explain why?

### **QUESTION 4-22 (Page 55)**
How is it possible that a change in a single amino acid in a protein of 1000 amino acids can destroy protein function, even when that amino acid is far away from any ligand-binding site?

### **QUESTION 4-23 (Page 55)**
The curve shown in Figure 4-35 is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation: rate (v) = Vmax[S]/(KM + [S]). Can you convince yourself that the features qualitatively described in the text are accurately represented by this equation? In particular, how can the equation be simplified when the substrate concentration [S] is in one of the following ranges: (A) [S] is much smaller than the KM, (B) [S] equals the KM, and (C) [S] is much larger than the KM?

### **QUESTION 4-24 (Page 55)**
The rate of a simple enzyme reaction is given by the standard Michaelis-Menten equation... If the Vmax of an enzyme is 100 µmole/sec and the KM is 1 mM, at what substrate concentration is the rate 50 µmole/sec? Plot a graph of rate versus substrate (S) concentration for [S] = 0 to 10 mM. Convert this to a plot of 1/rate versus 1/[S]. Why is the latter plot a straight line?

### **QUESTION 4-25 (Page 55)**
Select the correct options in the following and explain your choices. If [S] is very much smaller than KM, the active site of the enzyme is mostly occupied/unoccupied. If [S] is very much greater than KM, the reaction rate is limited by the enzyme/substrate concentration.

### **QUESTION 4-26 (Page 55)**
A. The reaction rates of the reaction S → P, catalyzed by enzyme E, were determined under conditions in which only very little product was formed. The data in the table below were measured, plot the data as a graph. Use this graph to estimate the KM and the Vmax for this enzyme.
B. To determine the KM and Vmax values more precisely, a trick is generally used in which the Michaelis-Menten equation is transformed so that it is possible to plot the data as a straight line... Calculate 1/rate and 1/[S] for the data given in part (A) and then plot 1/rate versus 1/[S] as a new graph. Determine KM and Vmax from the graph.
C. It is stated in part (A) that only very little product was formed under the reaction conditions. Why is this important?
D. Assume the enzyme is regulated such that upon phosphorylation its KM increases by a factor of 3 without changing its Vmax. Is this an activation or inhibition? Plot the data you would expect for the phosphorylated enzyme in both the graph for (A) and the graph for (B).
