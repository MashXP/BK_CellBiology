## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 19–1 (Page 11)**
Why do you think that organisms do not use the first steps of meiosis (up to and including meiotic division I) for the ordinary mitotic division of somatic cells?

### **QUESTION 19–2 (Page 12)**
Ignoring the effects of chromosome crossovers, an individual human can in principle produce 2²³ = 8.4 × 10⁶ genetically different gametes. How many of these possibilities can be "sampled" in the average life of (A) a female and (B) a male, given that women produce one egg a month during their fertile years, whereas men can make hundreds of millions of sperm each day?

### **QUESTION 19–3 (Page 13)**
Imagine that each chromosome undergoes one and only one crossover event on each chromatid during each meiosis. How would the co-inheritance of traits that are determined by genes at opposite ends of the same chromosome compare with the co-inheritance observed for genes on two different chromosomes? How does this compare with the actual situation?

### **QUESTION 19–4 (Page 29)**
When two individuals from different isolated, inbred subpopulations of a species come together and mate, their offspring often show "hybrid vigor": that is, they appear more robust, healthy, and fertile than either parent. Can you suggest a possible explanation for this phenomenon?

### **QUESTION 19–5 (Page 32)**
In a recent automated analysis, thousands of SNPs across the genome were analyzed in pooled DNA samples from humans who had been sorted into groups according to their age...a particular variant at one position was found to decrease in frequency progressively for people over 50 years old. Which of the possible explanations seems most likely?
A. The nucleotide in that SNP at that position is unstable, and mutates with age.
B. Those people born more than 50 years ago came from a population that tended to lack the disappearing SNP variant.
C. The SNP variant alters an important gene product in a way that shortens the human life-span, or is linked to a neighboring allele that has this effect.

### **QUESTION 19-6 (Page 38)**
It is easy to see how deleterious mutations in bacteria...are eliminated by natural selection...Consider the situation in which a defective form of the gene is lethal when homozygous, but without effect when heterozygous. Can such a mutation ever be eliminated from the population by natural selection? Why or why not?

### **QUESTION 19-7 (Page 38)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. The egg and sperm cells of animals contain haploid genomes.
B. During meiosis, chromosomes are allocated so that each germ cell obtains one and only one copy of each of the different chromosomes.
C. Mutations that arise during meiosis are not transmitted to the next generation.

### **QUESTION 19-8 (Page 38)**
What might cause chromosome nondisjunction, where two copies of the same chromosome end up in the same daughter cell? What could be the consequences of this event occurring (a) in mitosis and (b) in meiosis?

### **QUESTION 19-9 (Page 38)**
Why do sister chromatids have to remain paired in division I of meiosis? Does the answer suggest a strategy for washing your socks?

### **QUESTION 19-10 (Page 38)**
Distinguish between the following genetic terms: A. Gene and allele. B. Homozygous and heterozygous. C. Genotype and phenotype. D. Dominant and recessive.

### **QUESTION 19-11 (Page 39)**
You have been given three wrinkled peas, which we shall call A, B, and C...
A. Given that you know that the wrinkled-pea phenotype is recessive...what can you say about the genotype of each plant?
B. How do you determine if each of the three plants carries a mutation in the same gene or in different genes that produce the phenotype?

### **QUESTION 19-12 (Page 39)**
Susan's grandfather was deaf, and passed down a hereditary form of deafness within Susan's family as shown in Figure Q19-12.
A. Is this mutation most likely to be dominant or recessive?
B. Is it carried on a sex chromosome? Why or why not?
C. A complete SNP analysis has been done for all of the 11 grandchildren...how long a haplotype block would you expect to find around the critical gene?

### **QUESTION 19-13 (Page 39)**
Given that the mutation causing deafness in the family shown in Figure 19-26 is very rare, what is the most probable genotype of each of the four children in generation II?

### **QUESTION 19-14 (Page 39)**
In the pedigree shown in Figure Q19-14, the first born in each of three generations is the only person affected by a dominant genetically inherited disease...
A. According to Mendel's laws, is this conclusion plausible?
B. What is the probability of obtaining this result by chance?
C. What kind of additional data would be needed to test your friend's idea?

### **QUESTION 19-15 (Page 39)**
Suppose one person in 100 is a carrier of a fatal recessive mutation...In a population where there are 1,000,000 births per year, how many babies per year will be born with the lethal homozygous condition?

### **QUESTION 19-16 (Page 39)**
Certain mutations are called dominant-negative mutations. What do you think this means and how do you suppose these mutations act? Explain the difference between a dominant-negative mutation and a gain-of-function mutation.

### **QUESTION 19-17 (Page 39)**
Early genetic studies in Drosophila laid the foundation for our current understanding of genes...
A. How is it that flies with two different eye colors—ruby and white, for example—can give rise to progeny that all have brick-red eyes?
B. Which mutations are alleles of the same gene and which affect different genes?
C. How can different alleles of the same gene give different eye colors?

### **QUESTION 19-18 (Page 40)**
What are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and how can they be used to locate a mutant gene by linkage analysis?
