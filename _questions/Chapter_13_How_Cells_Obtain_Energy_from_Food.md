## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 13–1 (Page 7)**
At first glance, the final steps in fermentation appear to be unnecessary: the generation of lactate or ethanol does not produce any additional energy for the cell. Explain why cells growing in the absence of oxygen could not simply discard pyruvate as a waste product. Which products derived from glucose would accumulate in cells unable to generate either lactate or ethanol by fermentation?

### **QUESTION 13–2 (Page 9)**
Arsenate (AsO₄³⁻) is chemically very similar to phosphate (PO₄³⁻) and can be used as an alternative substrate by many phosphate-requiring enzymes. In contrast to phosphate, however, an anhydride bond between arsenate and carbon is very quickly hydrolyzed nonenzymatically in water. Knowing this, suggest why arsenate is a compound of choice for murderers but not for cells. Formulate your explanation in the context of Figure 13-7.

### **QUESTION 13–3 (Page 13)**
Many catabolic and anabolic reactions are based on reactions that are similar but work in opposite directions, such as the hydrolysis and condensation reactions described in Figure 3-39. This is true for fatty acid breakdown and fatty acid synthesis. From what you know about the mechanism of fatty acid breakdown outlined in Figure 13-11, would you expect the fatty acids found in cells to most commonly have an even or an odd number of carbon atoms?

### **QUESTION 13–4 (Page 15)**
Looking at the chemistry detailed in the overview of the citric acid cycle at the top of the first page of Panel 13-2 (p. 442), why do you suppose it is useful to link the two-carbon acetyl group to another, larger carbon skeleton, oxaloacetate, before completely oxidizing both of the acetyl-group carbons to CO₂? (See also Figure 13-12.)

### **QUESTION 13–5 (Page 20)**
What, if anything, is wrong with the following statement? "The oxygen consumed during the complete oxidation of glucose in animal cells is returned as part of CO₂ to the atmosphere." How could you support your answer experimentally?

### **QUESTION 13–6 (Page 21)**
A cyclic reaction pathway requires that the starting material be regenerated and available at the end of each cycle. If compounds of the citric acid cycle are siphoned off as building blocks to make other organic molecules via a variety of metabolic reactions (see Figure 13-14), why does the citric acid cycle not quickly grind to a halt?

### **QUESTION 13–7 (Page 24)**
After looking at the structures of sugars and fatty acids (discussed in Chapter 2), give an intuitive explanation as to why oxidation of a sugar yields only about half as much energy as the oxidation of an equivalent dry weight of a fatty acid.

### **QUESTION 13-8 (Page 26)**
The complete oxidation of sugar molecules by the cell takes place according to the general reaction C₆H₁₂O₆ (glucose) + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + energy. Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. All of the energy produced is in the form of heat.
B. None of the produced energy is in the form of heat.
C. The energy is produced by a process that involves the oxidation of carbon atoms.
D. The reaction supplies the cell with essential water.
E. In cells, the reaction takes place in more than one step.
F. Many steps in the oxidation of sugar molecules involve reaction with oxygen gas.
G. Some organisms carry out the reverse reaction.
H. Some cells that grow in the absence of O₂ produce CO₂.

### **QUESTION 13-9 (Page 26)**
An exceedingly sensitive instrument (yet to be devised) shows that one of the carbon atoms in Charles Darwin's last breath is resident in your bloodstream, where it forms part of a hemoglobin molecule. Suggest how this carbon atom might have traveled from Darwin to you, and list some of the molecules it could have entered en route.

### **QUESTION 13-10 (Page 26)**
Yeast cells can proliferate both in the presence of O₂ (aerobically) and in its absence (anaerobically). Under which of the two conditions could you expect the cells to proliferate better? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 13-11 (Page 26)**
During movement, muscle cells require large amounts of ATP to fuel their contractile apparatus. These cells contain high levels of creatine phosphate (Figure Q13-11), which has a standard free-energy change (ΔG°) for hydrolysis of its phosphate bond of –43 kJ/mole. Why is this a useful compound to store energy? Justify your answer with the information shown in Figure 13-8.

### **QUESTION 13-12 (Page 26)**
Identical pathways that make up the complicated sequence of reactions of glycolysis, shown in Panel 13-1 (pp. 436-437), are found in most living cells, from bacteria to humans. One could envision, however, countless alternative chemical reaction mechanisms that would allow the oxidation of sugar molecules and that could, in principle, have evolved to take the place of glycolysis. Discuss this fact in the context of evolution.

### **QUESTION 13-13 (Page 27)**
An animal cell, roughly cubical in shape with a side length of 10 µm, uses 10⁹ ATP molecules every minute. Assume that the cell replaces this ATP by the oxidation of glucose...How much oxygen does the cell consume every minute? How long will it take before the cell has used up an amount of oxygen gas equal to its own volume?

### **QUESTION 13-14 (Page 27)**
Under the conditions existing in the cell, the free energies of the first few reactions in glycolysis are: step 1 ΔG = –33.5 kJ/mole; step 2 ΔG = –2.5 kJ/mole; step 3 ΔG = –22.2 kJ/mole; step 4 ΔG = –1.3 kJ/mole. Are these reactions energetically favorable? Using these values, draw to scale an energy diagram (A) for the overall reaction and (B) for the pathway composed of the four individual reactions.

### **QUESTION 13-15 (Page 27)**
The chemistry of most metabolic reactions was deciphered by synthesizing metabolites containing atoms that are different isotopes...
A. Assume that pyruvate containing radioactive ¹⁴C in its carboxyl group is added to a cell extract that can support oxidative phosphorylation. Which of the molecules produced should contain the vast majority of the ¹⁴C that was added?
B. Assume that oxaloacetate containing radioactive ¹⁴C in its keto group is added to the extract. Where should the ¹⁴C atom be located after precisely one turn of the citric acid cycle?

### **QUESTION 13-16 (Page 27)**
In cells that can proliferate both aerobically and anaerobically, fermentation is inhibited in the presence of O₂. Suggest a reason for this observation.
