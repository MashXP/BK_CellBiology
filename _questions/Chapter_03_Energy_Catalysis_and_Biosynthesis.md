## **In-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 3–1 (Page 6)**
Consider the equation: light energy + CO₂ + H₂O → sugars + O₂ + heat energy.
Would you expect this reaction to occur in a single step? Why must heat be generated in the reaction? Explain your answers.

### **QUESTION 3–2 (Page 9)**
In which of the following reactions does the red atom undergo an oxidation?
A. Na → Na⁺ (Na atom → Na⁺ ion)
B. Cl → Cl⁻ (Cl atom → Cl⁻ ion)
C. CH₃CH₂OH → CH₃CHO (ethanol → acetaldehyde)
D. CH₃CHO → CH₃COO⁻ (acetaldehyde → acetic acid)
E. CH₂=CH₂ → CH₃CH₃ (ethene → ethane)

### **QUESTION 3–3 (Page 13)**
Consider the analogy of the jiggling box containing coins that was described on page 83. The reaction, the flipping of coins that either face heads up (H) or tails up (T), is described by the equation H ↔ T, where the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction.
A. What are ΔG and ΔG° in this analogy?
B. What corresponds to the temperature at which the reaction proceeds? What corresponds to the activation energy of the reaction? Assume you have an “enzyme,” called jigglase, which catalyzes this reaction. What would the effect of jigglase be and what, mechanically, might jigglase do in this analogy?

### **QUESTION 3–4 (Page 19)**
For the reactions shown in Figure 3-21, sketch an energy diagram similar to that in Figure 3-12 for the two reactions alone and for the combined reactions. Indicate the standard free-energy changes for the reactions X → Y, Y → Z, and X → Z in the graph. Indicate how enzymes that catalyze these reactions would change the energy diagram.

### **QUESTION 3–5 (Page 20)**
The enzyme carbonic anhydrase is one of the speediest enzymes known. It catalyzes the rapid conversion of CO₂ gas into the much more soluble bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻). The reaction: CO₂ + H₂O ↔ HCO₃⁻ + H⁺ is very important for the efficient transport of CO₂ from tissues, where CO₂ is produced by respiration, to the lungs, where it is exhaled. Carbonic anhydrase accelerates the reaction 10⁷-fold, hydrating 10⁵ CO₂ molecules per second at its maximal speed. What do you suppose limits the speed of the enzyme? Sketch a diagram analogous to the one shown in Figure 3-13 and indicate which portion of your diagram has been designed to display the 10⁷-fold acceleration.

### **QUESTION 3–6 (Page 20)**
In cells, an enzyme catalyzes the reaction AB → A + B. It was isolated, however, as an enzyme that carries out the opposite reaction A + B → AB. Explain the paradox.

### **QUESTION 3–7 (Page 24)**
Use Figure 3-29B to illustrate the following reaction driven by the hydrolysis of ATP: X + ATP → Y + ADP + Pᵢ
A. In this case, which molecule or molecules would be analogous to (i) rocks at the top of the cliff, (ii) broken debris at the bottom of the cliff, (iii) the bucket at its highest point, and (iv) the bucket on the ground?
B. What would be analogous to (i) the rocks hitting the ground in the absence of the paddle wheel in Figure 3-29A and (ii) the hydraulic machine in Figure 3-29C?

### **QUESTION 3–8 (Page 25)**
The phosphoanhydride bond that links two phosphate groups in ATP in a high-energy linkage has a ΔG° of –30.5 kJ/mole. Hydrolysis of this bond in a cell liberates from 46 to 54 kJ/mole of usable energy. How can this be? Why do you think a range of energies is given, rather than a precise number as for ΔG°?

### **QUESTION 3–9 (Page 31)**
Which of the following reactions will occur only if coupled to a second, energetically favorable reaction?
A. glucose + O₂ → CO₂ + H₂O
B. CO₂ + H₂O → glucose + O₂
C. nucleoside triphosphates → DNA
D. nucleotide bases → nucleoside triphosphates
E. ADP + Pᵢ → ATP

## **End-of-Chapter Questions**

### **QUESTION 3-10 (Page 34)**
Which of the following statements are correct? Explain your answers.
A. Some enzyme-catalyzed reactions cease completely if their enzyme is absent.
B. High-energy electrons (such as those found in the activated carriers NADH and NADPH) move faster around the atomic nucleus.
C. Hydrolysis of ATP to AMP can provide about twice as much energy as hydrolysis of ATP to ADP.
D. A partially oxidized carbon atom has a somewhat smaller diameter than a more reduced one.
E. Some activated carrier molecules can transfer both energy and a chemical group to a second molecule.
F. The rule that oxidations release energy, whereas reductions require energy input, applies to all chemical reactions, not just those that occur in living cells.
G. Cold-blooded animals have an energetic disadvantage because they release less heat to the environment than warm-blooded animals do. This slows their ability to make ordered macromolecules.
H. Linking the reaction X → Y to a second, energetically favorable reaction Y → Z will shift the equilibrium constant of the first reaction.

### **QUESTION 3-11 (Page 34)**
Consider a transition of X ↔ Y. Assume that the only difference between X and Y is the presence of three hydrogen bonds in Y that are absent in X. What is the ratio of X to Y when the reaction is in equilibrium? Approximate your answer by using Table 3-1 (p. 96), with 4.2 kJ/mole as the energy of each hydrogen bond. If Y instead has six hydrogen bonds that distinguish it from X, how would that change the ratio?

### **QUESTION 3-12 (Page 34)**
Protein A binds to protein B to form a complex, AB. At equilibrium in a cell the concentrations of A, B, and AB are all at 1 µM.
A. Referring to Figure 3-19, calculate the equilibrium constant for the reaction A + B → AB.
B. What would the equilibrium constant be if A, B, and AB were each present in equilibrium at the much lower concentrations of 1 nM each?
C. How many extra hydrogen bonds would be needed to hold A and B together at this lower concentration so that a similar proportion of the molecules are found in the AB complex? (Remember that each hydrogen bond contributes about 4.2 kJ/mole.)

### **QUESTION 3-13 (Page 34)**
Discuss the following statement: "Whether the ΔG for a reaction is larger, smaller, or the same as ΔG° depends on the concentration of the compounds that participate in the reaction."

### **QUESTION 3-14 (Page 34)**
A. How many ATP molecules could maximally be generated from one molecule of glucose, if the complete oxidation of 1 mole of glucose to CO₂ and H₂O yields 2867 kJ of free energy and the useful chemical energy available in the high-energy phosphate bond of 1 mole of ATP is 50 kJ?
B. As we will see in Chapter 14 (Table 14-1), respiration produces 30 moles of ATP from 1 mole of glucose. Compare this number with your answer in part (A). What is the overall efficiency of ATP production from glucose?
C. If the cells of your body oxidize 1 mole of glucose, by how much would the temperature of your body (assume that your body consists of 75 kg of water) increase if the heat were not dissipated into the environment?
D. What would the consequences be if the cells of your body could convert the energy in food substances with only 20% efficiency?
E. A resting human hydrolyzes about 40 kg of ATP every 24 hours. The oxidation of how much glucose would produce this amount of energy?

### **QUESTION 3-15 (Page 35)**
A prominent scientist claims to have isolated mutant cells that can convert 1 molecule of glucose into 57 molecules of ATP. Should this discovery be celebrated, or do you suppose that something might be wrong with it? Explain your answer.

### **QUESTION 3-16 (Page 35)**
In a simple reaction A ↔ A*, a molecule is interconvertible between two forms that differ in standard free energy G° by 18 kJ/mole, with A* having the higher G°.
A. Use Table 3-1 (p. 96) to find how many more molecules will be in state A* compared with state A at equilibrium.
B. If an enzyme lowered the activation energy of the reaction by 11.7 kJ/mole, how would the ratio of A to A* change?

### **QUESTION 3-17 (Page 35)**
In a mushroom, a reaction in a single-step biosynthetic pathway that converts a metabolite into a particularly vicious poison (metabolite ↔ poison) is energetically highly unfavorable. The reaction is normally driven by ATP hydrolysis. Assume that a mutation in the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction prevents it from utilizing ATP, but still allows it to catalyze the reaction.
A. Do you suppose it might be safe for you to eat a mushroom that bears this mutation?
B. Would your answer be different for another mutant mushroom whose enzyme couples the reaction to ATP hydrolysis but works 100 times more slowly?

### **QUESTION 3-18 (Page 35)**
Consider the effects of two enzymes, A and B. Enzyme A catalyzes the reaction ATP + GDP ↔ ADP + GTP and enzyme B catalyzes the reaction NADH + NADP⁺ ↔ NAD⁺ + NADPH. Discuss whether the enzymes would be beneficial or detrimental to cells.

### **QUESTION 3-19 (Page 35)**
Discuss the following statement: “Enzymes and heat are alike in that both can speed up reactions that—although thermodynamically feasible—do not occur at an appreciable rate because they require a high activation energy. Diseases that seem to benefit from the careful application of heat—in the form of hot chicken soup, for example—are therefore likely to be due to the insufficient function of an enzyme.”
